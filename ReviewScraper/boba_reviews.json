It is nearby Yonge-Dundas square, the mall, restaurants, and the theatre. I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is. It can get really crowded even if you are just getting takeout. There isn't much space for you to stand while waiting for your drink.","_id":{"$oid":"1e888a10fcd111ec8e8ad0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"1c570603fcd111ec86b9d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"J L.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"6\/10\/2017","reviewMessage":"The line up, which can sometimes go all the way to the back of the store and wrap back towards the entrance, can get a bit unruly during rush hour, but for bubble tea addicts like me, Chatime is a staple. They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it's worth getting the free card if you think you'll be back in the future. There's also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I've been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.","_id":{"$oid":"1ecbfb64fcd111eca31cd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"1c570603fcd111ec86b9d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Andy L.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"11\/12\/2016","reviewMessage":"Since it's a downtown location (and really close to Eaton center) it's no wonder it's always busy. Lineup all the way to the back and it was 3pm on a Saturday. Ordered two roasted milk teas with grass jelly with less ice and half sugar. The ice was definitely more than what I expected; ended up tasting watered down at the end. It was more ice than I would get at the pacific mall or midland\/finch locations. I'd rather get my fill from those other locations than here. There was, however, a good amount of grass jelly. If youve never tried chatime, you should.

Though I typically go during not really bubble tea hours....like random times during the workday, and it still seems to have a line. As with all Chatimes...I like that they use real tea, not the powdered stuff. And I'm especially addicted to their Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly. Their grass jelly is slightly sweet, so I usually get no sugar and less ice to no ice.

A safe bet is to go with their original roasted milk tea bubble teas. Right when you enter one you can smell the teas being roasted I LOVE IT! It's the best milk tea I've tasted around although some might argue with me. Line ups at this location is always long reaching to the end of the restaurant, it's around a 10-15 minute wait. I always get it with roasted jelly which is BOMB. I get 30% sugar but recently I've been going with 0% which I honestly think is just fine. Theres still a hint of sweetness from the grass jelly and the flavour is still there. Other drinks I really enjoy is the Oolong milk tea and the taro milk tea, both super good, taro especially. You can tasted the real flavour of the taro and the texture. Although I feel the texture of the taro has been watered down quite a bit since a few years ago.","_id":{"$oid":"2060c0aefcd111ecaa36d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"1c570603fcd111ec86b9d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Marz R.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"3\/19\/2016","reviewMessage":"This location isn't as good as some of the others.

They were surprised at how busy it was and automatically had high hopes for this place, and they were not disappointed. It was almost 11pm and there were still lines winding throughout the store. I honestly think they should consider expanding their store as they were so busy. They didn't have enough space inside to accommodate the line and people sitting, as the people in line were literally 5cm from the people sitting. I do give them credit though for moving the line relatively quick. The Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea was really good, and they followed directions with ice and sweetness perfectly.

I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn't watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn't overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn't see there's an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me.

Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste.

You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...)

The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar\/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea","_id":{"$oid":"26bd1c27fcd111ec973fd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"25902f4cfcd111ecb120d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Jonny M.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"8\/7\/2014","reviewMessage":"Where do you go when you're only in town for one day?

There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don't see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what's so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what's with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn't enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don't even know what you get if you didn't--like what's the default ice and sugar? Let's not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca\/'boba'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they're not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there's a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don't get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn't blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it's the 505 or the Bay bus.}","_id":{"$oid":"2b957d76fcd111ec96a3d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"2a106216fcd111ec9d44d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Tom N.","reviewRating":2.0,"reviewDate":"3\/7\/2014","reviewMessage":"I've come here 5 times, and 4 times they got my drink wrong.

AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)","_id":{"$oid":"2f8b37d1fcd111ecbe09d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"2ece25a6fcd111ec991bd0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Justine H.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"9\/10\/2011","reviewMessage":"Restaurant: Chatime Bubble Tea Cuisine: Coffee\/Tea\/Dessert Location: Downtown Toronto Address: 132 Dundas St. W Price Range: ~$10 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5 Extra information: *Wifi Avail *500 Stores WorldWide *Taxes included in the Price *Choose Ice and Sugar Option I've been drinking bbtea for at least last 12 years of my life, and that is A LOT of bbtea and pearls. Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends.

I ordered the original Deerioca with soy milk, since my body violently rejects any amount of lactose, and it was delicious. Keep in mind that while you can customize the ice and sweetness levels on most other drinks, you can only change the type of milk for the Deerioca series. When the cup first touches your hands you are greeted by the warmth of freshly cooked bubbles soaked in a sweet and balanced brown sugar syrup. These bubbles have the perfect amount of chew and bounce and all of them were cooked consistently. The closest comparison I could draw are the bubbles from Boba Guys, which happens to be my favorite bubble tea spot in the states. The brown sugar syrup from the bubbles mixed with the soy milk gave the drink a taste reminiscent of cereal milk, but in my opinion it was delicious nonetheless. However, the drink itself was a tad light and could have used a bit more tea flavor. My friend ordered the Iron Goddess milk tea which had much more of a traditional bubble tea taste so if that's your jam I would recommend ordering from that part of the menu. There is ample seating with a modern wood-cabin aesthetic if you want to grab a delicious drink and get some work done.

The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2\/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.","_id":{"$oid":"392605b7fcd111ecac3fd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"36b14871fcd111ec8fc7d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Ada L.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"1\/19\/2019","reviewMessage":"Can you believe the first time I tried The Alley was...just a few weeks ago?

While the Alley is pricier than most areas, I firmly believe the increase in price is well worth it. The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever. Honestly, there's no item on the menu I wouldn't recommend trying out at least once.

Iron Goddess is a flavourful milk tea which I'll usually pair up with tapioca and coffee jelly and the oh so sweet..brown sugar deerioca with soy milk. The tapioca is very sweet and warm but with the freshness from the soy milk, it balances out really well. As pretty as it is, with the syrup drizzle on the side of the cup..I always shake it up really well because all the gooey syrup is at the bottom, it's like sucking up diabetes right there haha. I'm just upset it only comes in the smaller size!

I am not too fussed with paying more for tea, if the tea is indeed richer and has a better flavour profile. The Iron Goddess milk tea was very bland and seemed diluted. You can definitely taste the bluebery notes in No. 9. You can try a sample of it at the counter and what they had was so incredibly sweet. Tapioca was good, not as chewy as Chatime's. Service was okay, I would've expected the drinks to be ready more quickly given the number of staff working. Their cup is sealed with a fancier plastic which looks nice but it doesn't seal well and our drinks spilled.

I can see why The Alley is getting a lot of love... it's very good. Possibly one of my favourites in recent memory but I feel like I need to return to try more to see if it's a 5 star! The Alley sits at the base of a newer building and is a stone's throw away from Yonge st. It's clean, modern, and quite spacious for a place in the heart of Toronto. Unlike other spots on Yonge, It has nice light and higher ceilings. It has a fair amount of seating if you want to enjoy your tea there and even the take out area wouldnt be too crowded since it's wider than the 3 other nearby bubble tea places. The aesthetics is a-dork-able... I think it's so cute. It plays off their 'mascot' which is a reindeer. The antlers and face is peppered about the room. Their takeaway container has the antlers coming out of the cardboard and is used to anchor the string that holds it like a drawstring bag. Im doing it no justice in explaining how adorkable it is... just look at my pics. IT'S SO CUTE! Another great thing about this place... service. Quick, efficient, happy, and completely knowledgeable and full patience to explain their menu. You need that explanation because this isn't your usual powdery regular bubble tea. OH noooo... this is the real deal. Freshly brewed tea with in house made boba that are perfect QQ chewy texture. There are so many different teas to chose from as your base... assam, green tea, iron goddess, jasmine, oolong... you get the idea. They also have several instagram worthy ones that have a lovely gradient of colours. With the super friendly staff, I decided to go with their best seller and totally appreciated the small sample to try before hand.... Royal Tea No.9. Royal Tea No.9 - Explained as a medium strength black tea with blueberry flavour. I remember my first bubble tea actually being a powdery and insanely sugary blueberry bubble tea. I WISHED this was my first bubble tea because this would have gotten me addicted to bubble tea but it'd be a happy addiction! This had a nice mellow black tea flavour that was really clear from the first sip... like a nice mellow English Breakfast. Then the blueberry flavour hits you at the end and it's not a sugary fake scent... this reminded me truly of the fruit! I got mine half sweet and feel thats just the perfect sweetness for me to balance off the natural black tea flavour. I LOVED the pearls! They mentioned they make it in house and it was perfectly chewy and soft. Not overcooked. I can understand why this would be their best seller. Definitely beats all other new spots I've tried recently. 4.5\/5 With a huge menu of new and innovative different drinks, I'm loving their offering and it makes me want to come back to try new things. I usually stick to the basics... Roasted or regular black milk tea. Not here! I'm completely sold on their great service, bubble tea, and possibly the cutest thing I've seen in a restaurant in a long time!","_id":{"$oid":"3ad26655fcd111ec9c32d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"36b14871fcd111ec8fc7d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Gloria Y.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"2\/13\/2018","reviewMessage":"The Alley is becoming one of my favourite bubble tea places, having been here a number of times and tried many of their drinks.

Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant.

I wanted something straightforward with a strong tea flavor, so this was recommended to me. Strong tea flavor is right. Nothing is milked down or watered down here.

This is by far the best bubble tea shop I've been to. NY really needs to step up their bubble tea game. Bubble tea shops in NY cheap out on ingredients and toppings even when you're charged for it. The Alley charges for toppings, but they give a decent amount for their drink sizes. There was topping in every sip I took! Royal No. 9 Milk Tea: Tastes like the gummy in Meiji Chocolate Gummy Candy. Not sure if anyone else thinks the same or maybe just me. Sugar level can be adjusted to your preference. Apple of My Eye: Not my cup of bubble tea. It tastes like the Chinese vinegar drink that I'm not fond of. Although, it's quite refreshing after getting used to it. White Peach Oolong: There's no sugar added. The cashier recommended me to add pineapple jelly in it for some texture and sweetness. Thank goodness I trusted her! Great drink after a heavy or salty meal and you just want something to help digest\/refresh your mouth. The second time I ordered this, I added pineapple jelly and aloe (best decision ever). Ginger Roasted Milk Tea (only comes in hot & one size): Wished they had a large for this. Has a strong ginger and roasted milk tea taste.

I wanted to order the Deerioca too, but they just happen to be sold out. Royal No. 9 milk tea is good, with a slight blueberry aftertaste. The tapioca is well cooked. I'm not personally very fond of blueberries so this drink is not very special for me. The lack of tea taste also really threw me off. However, I can imagine fans of blueberry loving this drink. The white peach oolong looks just like a tea bag in water. I don't know if that justifies the $5 price tag on it. It is actually the pumpkin party drink that I really liked. It is actually much better than a Frappuccino, the sweet pumpkin syrup is out of this world!!

The first drink I tried was the \"Deerioca\", which consisted of milk and brown sugar. It tasted like any iced milk drink from the usual Asian tea franchises in the states. (e.g. Half and Half, Ten Ren's, Twinkle Twinkle Brown Sugar). The only difference is that the Deerioca does not have a blended ice consistency. Still, I wouldn't call it a truly unique drink, although I certainly enjoyed it. Another thing to note: you cannot adjust the sweetness or ice level for the Deerioca. Also, the drink only comes in the regular size. Keep this in mind if you typically prefer 50% or lower amounts of sweetness in your drinks. The only other drink I've tried here was the Royal No.9 milk tea. If it weren't for the positive yelp reviews, I probably would not have tried this. I really enjoyed the drink and its unique taste. Basically, it's milk tea with a subtle but delicate blueberry flavor. I've only been to the Alley 3 times but they always had samples available. I highly recommend this drink.

Since it was my first time here, I wanted to try one of their more popular items. After browsing through the menu, I settled for the Royal No 9 milk tea with some tapioca. I normally get less sugar and less ice but I wanted to try it at their regular level to gauge what their take on \"regular\" sweetness would be. The conclusion is that their sweetness is on the lower end of other places but I would still order less sugar and less ice next time around. I really liked the Royal No 9 milk tea. You can taste the steeped tea flavour and not overly mixed with the milk and the sweetener. The tapioca was a nice chewy texture that wasn't overly rubbery. I hear that they make their tapioca fresh and I wonder if that is still the case after being open for quite some time. Their crowd dazzler is their aurora series of drinks which is in a glass jar.

I always appreciated The Alley's first Canadian location in Richmond Hill. The downtown location has a rustic and modern interior. Sitting is somewhat limited. I opted for the Royal No. 9 milk tea ($5 + 0.5 toppings). The Alley did not disappoint. The tea finishes with a hint of blueberry. Sugar cane syrup is made in house. Tapioca or Deerioca (as they coined it) are made from scratch; kneading and rolling fresh dough into small tapioca balls. With that being said, the tapioca to drink ratio felt slightly off.

A huge reason is because their drinks don't taste as powder-artificial as other bubble tea chains, and they're good at brewing a strong tea. The Royal 9 milk tea has been an Asian hit for years and at this shop it's a blend of black tea and blueberry tea leaves, but I've recalled having a rose variety. The brown sugar ginger milk tea is very gingery and refreshing, not too sweet despite not being able to adjust the sweetness. You'll feel the zing and heat of the ginger. The purple rice cocoa is a welcomed spin on a hot chocolate that has the soothing quality and rice-y sweetness of purple rice (a popular feature in Thai and Chinese desserts) The \"classic milk tea\" however is rather bland and despite delivering a buzz, left my tea craving unsatisfied. The hojicha soy milk (roasted rice tea, infused in soy milk!) is lightly sweetened, and a great combo.

The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether.

I've been to the one in Markham and really liked it there - this place downtown is comparable. Their top drink is their Royal No.9 milk tea which is a blueberry milk tea. Veeeery good - I totally see why it's their top seller. They usually give out free samples of this drink near the cash register because it's so popular (I always take a sample even though I know how it tastes already, haha). I also tried their northern lights drink, the passion fruit green tea, and their oreo devil slush. All very good. The passion fruit green tea isn't as great as other tea shops I've been to but it's decent! And the northern lights drink isn't too bad.. tastes like freshly juiced grapes and looks like a cool little galaxy in a bottle - you get a nice little bottle too!

I absolutely loved the interior decor, much more modern and sophisticated than your average store. There's enough seating for 12-15 people, the main area is quite spacious so you can wait for your order without suffering a bout of claustrophobia, the preparation\/kitchen area is kept immaculate, staffs are polite and helpful, superior selections of tea that you'll mainly see at brewed-to-order cafes. Prices are reasonable, though everything in Toronto seems to rival prices of more expensive parts of nyc. We ordered an iced hojicha latte (with bubbles) and their alley trio bubble tea. Hojicha - I love hojicha, my favourite tea of all teas so I had high expectations after being disappointed with boba guys. I can't say these guys delivered on that front either, the hojicha flavour came through but was SUPER concentrated, even the colour (after being mixed in with the milk thoroughly) was 10 shades too dark. I recommend getting it less sweet as it was overwhelmingly sweet, add the sugar from the bubbles and it was hard for me to finish. **sigggghhhh** just disappointing :( Trio bubble milk tea - it was just classic milk tea, 'trio' referring to the 3 types of toppings which were pearls\/jelly and something else I can't remember. We ordered it to be less sweet, thank god we did because the sugar from the toppings gave it the perfect amount of sweetness. I was very pleased with this one, and would recommend others give it a go.

Consistently, The Alley was mentioned as the best place. Of course, I hyped myself up with high expectations and was not looking to be disappointed. The Alley was quite away from my hotel but in the end, it was worth the walk! I was not disappointed. This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip.

I'm ok with the basic stuff so it works out for me. Other places also offer their own \"triple topping\" combos but I think the rainbow jelly was a good choice cause it provided some fruity flavors.

If you opt to get a hot drink, you get a cute cup with a deer shaped cup holder. I would be lying if I said I didn't order the hot drink just for the cup holder (haha).

I could really taste the hint of blueberry! Will definitely come again for the drink! As per those who are thinking of getting their trio milk tea, if you like coconut\/fruit jelly in your milk tea, by all means ~ but if you're someone who doesn't mix well with a combination of fruits, milk and tea - I might tell you to avoid it and try something else - it is definitely a more adventurous pick!!

I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!).

The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It's a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I'm pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That's how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they're always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you're in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there's all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley's Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they're famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley's signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow's milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you'll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn't get more solid. I'd been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn't described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don't just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn't quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I'm not sure what I expected, but what I r","_id":{"$oid":"46f491b6fcd111ec8d1dd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"45e4b3c9fcd111ec8b39d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Lisa C.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"7\/26\/2019","reviewMessage":"I've been wanting to try this place because I loveeee bubble tea and more importantly fell in love with the brown sugar bubble tea from Taiwan.

The restaurant has a nice feeling and all of the employees are really friendly, helpful and kind. Before I placed my order, I told the employee I was both gluten and lactose intolerant. The two employees working at the counter recommended I try the Brown Sugar Deerioca or the ginger sweet tea since I had a sore throat. I decided to order the Brown Sugar Deerioca beverage to enjoy at the restaurant and I ended up getting the Sweet Ginger Tea to-go. When I received the Brown Sugar Deerioca, it was presented in three beautiful layers. The dark coloured tapioca was prominent at the bottom of the cup and a rich caramel colour was above it with a creamy white colour on top. I mixed the three layers together and will try my best to describe the amazing flavour of this drink. The tapioca was fresh, warm and chewy; I could tell it had just been cooked. The flavour of the brown sugar layer and the almond milk layer were fantastic! It tasted like a sugar syrup you would bake on the stove yet it also kind of reminded me of cotton candy. It made my mind think of a delicious caramel sauce. The flavour pallet of this bubble tea was beyond any type I have tried in the past. It was definitely an experience and I highly recommend you check it out too. Ginger Sweet Tea To-Go! The sweet ginger tea tasted really good and definitely helped soothe my sore throat. If you're feeling a bit under the weather this would definitely help you. Now for the ICING on the CAKE! My to-go drink had a special touch most restaurants do not have. My to-go cup was served with a deer sleeve that had a strap that allows guests to carry their beverage out of the store without burning their hands. The drink sleeve had a handle. It was the most adorable drink sleeve I have ever used and I hope more restaurants start implementing sleeves like this. It is very creative and innovative. To see what it looks like, find my photo. In Summary: ... I would definitely return to this bubble tea restaurant when in the area. Tip: Make sure you get their loyalty card.","_id":{"$oid":"49c5caa4fcd111ec8dfbd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"45e4b3c9fcd111ec8b39d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Gloria Y.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"2\/13\/2018","reviewMessage":"The Alley is becoming one of my favourite bubble tea places, having been here a number of times and tried many of their drinks.

The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It's a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I'm pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That's how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they're always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you're in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there's all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley's Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they're famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley's signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow's milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you'll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn't get more solid. I'd been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn't described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don't just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn't quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I'm not sure what I expected, but what I r","_id":{"$oid":"4b51a78bfcd111ecae02d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"4a406254fcd111eca7dfd0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Eli L.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"6\/25\/2019","reviewMessage":"I got the iced deerioca fever with fresh milk, and it was amazing!

Very relaxed, with outlets along the window. More space than the usual boba place. Appearance 5\/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3\/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2\/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.","_id":{"$oid":"4c026d4ffcd111ec97a0d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"4a406254fcd111eca7dfd0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Shirley H.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"1\/28\/2019","reviewMessage":"Yummy deerioca fever aka brown sugar bubble in fresh milk.

I've to say, Royal No.9 is my favourite of the three - it is light with a hint of blueberry after taste, very different from other milk teas. The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about.

Their drink list is extensive categorized from milk tea to fresh milk to fruit teas. The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great!

Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever.

You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended!

The deerioca tea has mostly a milky taste and the brown sugar slow cooked boba is what gives most of the sweetness and it's addictive.

I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!).

The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend.

The tea has a hint of blueberry, a bit fruity which I really enjoy. + The tapioca was not sweet enough, but I like its chewy texture tho - Portion: comes in regular size and large size, did not give enough tapioca tho, I might order 2 toppings next time.

The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall.

The first thing I would try here is Brown sugar deerioca fever with fresh milk. It was just best of the best! You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended! It also came in a very cute bottle. The only thing I did not like nor anticipate is parking.

We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this.

Their drink list is extensive categorized from milk tea to fresh milk to fruit teas. The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great! I definitely recommend trying this spot.","_id":{"$oid":"6511df97fcd111eca0dcd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"62530f8ffcd111ec96c0d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Anna D.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"10\/22\/2017","reviewMessage":"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.","_id":{"$oid":"65b17a80fcd111ecb484d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"62530f8ffcd111ec96c0d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Lisa C.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"7\/26\/2019","reviewMessage":"I've been wanting to try this place because I loveeee bubble tea and more importantly fell in love with the brown sugar bubble tea from Taiwan.

I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic!

Icha Tea (\u4e00\u8336\u9593) is known as the heaven for tea lovers on Spadina Avenue. Once you step in, you can first order at the counter. There are a few seats where you can sit and wait for your takeout orders. Otherwise, you can continue to walk inside, passing through an authentic Chinese tea bar, and you can then find more seatings. It is spacious and quiet. There are many students working in the corner, as well as groups chilling around with drinks and desserts. You can order tea-infused bubble tea at the storefront, and I decided to order a simple, classic Matcha Latte. The shop uses Isuzu Matcha (\u4e94\u5341\u9234) in their drinks, and they are prepared fresh to order. Though the drink does look delicious, it tastes bland. Matcha flavor is overpowered by the milk itself, which means more matcha powder is needed to make a richer drink. It is quite disappointing to try this in a tea bar. Anyway, we also ordered two desserts, which are Sesame Tofu Cheesecake and Matcha Roll. We were asked to wait for 15 minutes because the roll cake is in the processing of defrosting. Since we had some spare time, so we decided to first try the Sesame Tofu Cheesecake. It is a square-shaped cheesecake with crackers crumb as a base. The cheesecake itself has a strong, pungent sesame flavor, yet tofu flavor is lacking. I was expecting the texture to be silky soft like tofu or at least creamy. It is still creamy, but it is on a harder side. After 20 minutes of wait, the Matcha Roll arrived, and it is totally worth the wait. The matcha cream is creamy and strong. The matcha flavor is left in my mouth after each bite. The cake is soft and spongy. The proportion of cake and cream is perfect, so I don't feel heavy after finishing it. For $5.50, I would totally order this again. *** Overall Impression *** There are definitely hit and miss items at Icha Tea. However, the service is great, and I like how the tea bar is quiet and spacious, with many seatings. Though it has 4.6\/5 on Google review, I think it is slightly overrated, as they cannot perfect a cup of matcha latte. I could be ordering the wrong drinks because after all, it is a Chinese tea bar. One item I highly recommend is the Matcha Roll. I would come back again for other desserts on the menu, as well as trying some real tea next time!

Upon receiving the drink, I was able to snap some aesthetic photos as the interior here was very gorgeous and visually appealing. I also did not know the Matcha Latte Milk Tea needed to be mixed up before drinking, but the barista afterward kindly told me the drink tastes much better when mixed. The Matcha drink tasted a little bitter as expected since it is essentially green tea, but a bit sweet as well since it is milk tea. The tapioca tasted very standard and wasn't very bland nor sweet. There is a bigger seating area when you walk deeper into the store, in which the lighting is very dim which gives off a very relaxing vibe. Also, no outside foods are allowed!

If you walk by too quickly you might just miss its tiny storefront. At first glance it appears that Icha Tea is a quick-serve bubble tea shop but if you walk inside, it offers so much more. The front of the shop has a counter for grab and go drinks but the narrow shop actually keeps going and there is lot of seating in the back with a relaxing ambiance. The decor is very cute with displays of ceramic tea wares including some that are available for purchase. There is a bar space where guests can enjoy a traditional Gong Fu tea pouring experience and learn more about Chinese tea customs. If you would rather pour your own tea, you can also get a tea set on a tray with a little teapot and small cups for sharing. Icha Tea's main focus is high quality loose leaf teas from China and Taiwan which still applies to their milk teas and bubble teas as well. You definitely won't find any powdered drink mixes here. I have tried both their tea bar and their milk teas and you can really taste the difference. The tea itself is more fragrant and there are many kinds to choose from. One of my favourite loose leaf teas is the Milk Oolong which is actually enjoyed black but it naturally has a creamy caramel scent. From their quick service teas, I really loved the iced matcha latte with tapioca pearls. The Japanese matcha is whisked to order and you can choose your sweetness level. In general, the sweetness level here is much lower than other tea spots, so you might have to order it on the sweeter side if that is what you are used to. I have also tried some of their house made desserts and they are quite unique and delicious. I really like the Black Sesame Tofu Cheesecake which is light and nutty. I also love their Jasmine Rose Pudding which is very floral and has the texture of a mousse mixed with a panna cotta. Service is always so warm and friendly here too.

This place is different. The drinks are made with freshly brewed tea, which obviously takes longer to make but is so worth it. The drinks are also a little more expensive than your typical bubble tea, but again, it's worth it. I got the rose jasmine bubble tea, and it was absolutely delicious. I think the sugar is already toned down here compared to your average bubble tea, so even if you normally reduce down to 50% sugar in your standard bubble tea\/latte\/frappuccino, I wouldn't recommend doing that here. The interior is really nice. At first glance, it looks like a super tiny shop, but once you walked inside, there's a nice sitting area in the back. I wish I had taken pictures to show just how nice this place looks. There's an intimate vibe that makes this place seem like it'd be really good for studying and just having a quiet chat with a friend.

The first time I went, I asked what's good and was told the Osmanthus Oolong Milk Tea was his favourite, so I got that and the blessed Matcha Latte. I didn't like the Osmanthus beverage.

He was showing what I'm assuming was a new employee how to make the drink and he was being so patient and showing her how it should be done and what not to do.

I had ordered the oolong milk tea with pearls and got another one which was the rose jasmine cheese foam tea. They brew the tea fresh in the stores with quality ingredients and tea leaves, so the quality is there. First initial sips of both drinks I found it very watered down and did not taste alot of the tea flavor in both. The milk tea did not have a strong tea flavor which I was hoping for and with the cheese foam it just tasted like a very fresh flower (whatever that means if you eat flowers? ) The pearls were a bit overcooked and a little soft and mushy but not a big deal. Just overall, I had higher expectations for the taste of the drinks but didn't get what I thought. Perhaps the sugar level I got was not enough and maybe that's the factor on why I thought the drinks didn't taste as good.

There is a bigger seating area when you walk deeper into the store, in which the lighting is very dim which gives off a very relaxing vibe. Also, no outside foods are allowed!

They're a brewed-to-order tea house with a super cute cafe setup at the front of the store (seating for about 10 people), to the rear it there appeared to be a larger room with classical-style tables and chairs (which I assume is for formal tea services). They have a small but beautiful selection of desserts to have with your tea, mostly uncommon flavours like black sesame and lapsang (flavoured from a type of black tea). The desserts aren't overtly sweet but rather subtly compliments your tea. I ordered the lapsang cheesecake with a large classic milk tea (25% sugar, bubbles). The tea was very fragrant, not being overpowered by the milk, the bubbles were a lovely chewy texture with a touch of firmness in the centre. The only thing I might of changed was perhaps increasing the sweetness level to really bring out the maximum flavours of the tea. The cheesecake was to die for, I think the base of the actual filling must have been tofu which gave it a much lighter density, the flavours of the tea cut through the filling, the base was a soft moist crumble and I loved the gelatine film that decorated the top. The flavours married together very well, it was the first cheesecake I've had that was subtly sweet and it's been one of the best dessert experiences to date. The cafe isn't a place for group gatherings, perhaps a hangout spot with a friend, definitely a date stop off. Not child friendly, or wheelchair\/stroller accessible.

Unlike other bubble tea places I've been to, they brew your tea fresh right in front of you. Recommendations are key, as some teas can be stronger than others - so don't be scared to ask! We got one classic milk tea and one osmanthus oolong tea. The wait wasn't bad as there were other customers ahead of us, but what I loved was the connection they made with each other customer. The tea itself is great, especially in the milk tea. It has a richer flavour to it than the powdered milk teas. As for the tapioca, it needs to be a bit more sweeter to make it perfect. I would hit this spot in the summer if you're looking for something different in your bubble tea adventure.","_id":{"$oid":"802161abfcd111eca7e0d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"7ef0944efcd111eca885d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Keren C.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"12\/27\/2017","reviewMessage":"I came here with a friend and the ambiance of the place is great.

There is a tea bar where you can sit and observe your tea being made in a traditional method (pouring and repouring to get the temperature right). Yet there's a sense of casualness in this old method. Around the bar where I sat, quaint teapots and little cups scattered around in the most charming messy way. You will surely be entertained by looking at the various shapes and art from those tea sets. I ordered the jasmine green tea from the menu, and the girl behind the bar proceeded to make my tea, starting with steeping the tea leaves. She poured the tea from one container to another repeatedly, feeling the temperature of the container with her hands until she was satisfied, then she poured the tea into the pot and presented it to me. With some of the other teas, she also took a whiff to smell the tea to see if they were ready. My tea was amazing. The fragrance was so lovely and the taste was calming. No trace of bitter taste. Unlike wine tasting where you get the tasting for free if you buy the bottle, this tea shop doesn't operate this way lol. You pay for the tea tasting, and the tea leaves by grams if you wish to bring some home. This experience and products don't come cheap.

The price and quality of the drink (to me) is much better than other bubble tea places that I've tried. The bubbles are cooked just right! I think this is the best tapioca place I've tried - they also have a coat of sugar.. which make them less plain! Hence, get less sugar in your drink. They usually have monthly specials - large for $3.80. The reason why I'm giving it a 4* instead of a 5* is because I had a bad incident with one of their drinks. They had a special, which was their black tea latte. Black tea latte is literally 3\/4 fresh milk, and 1\/4 black tea. Much like a milk tea but... mostly milk! I guess the day I got it... the milk was not fresh - it tasted very off. Also, much like other places, I do not think they pay attention to the sugar levels if you ask for 30%, 50% or 70%.

Fun Fact: I find it so interesting that CoCo Tea makes 100 Pearl Milk Teas every second across the globe.","_id":{"$oid":"937c1dfefcd111ecbc66d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"9287fbddfcd111eca9b8d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Sarah K.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"4\/18\/2016","reviewMessage":"This location is close to Yonge and Wellesley which is perfect if you're looking to grab a drink nearby after dinner or just to hang out.

The line moved slowly- there were a few people waiting with their receipts (a receipt has your order number). Drink: I ordered matcha milk tea with 50% sugar & tapioca. I'm glad that I asked the lady at the counter before ordering since even with 50% sugar, the drink was still a bit sweet. I love tapioca and I have a sweet tooth- but the tapioca from here were way too sweet. It felt like I was chewing sugar balls, so by the end, it was difficult to try to finish them. Next time, I would order another bubble tea with 30% sugar & without tapioca. It seems that CoCo's bubble teas are on the sweet side.

I've had CoCo in China before and I thought it was an okay bubble tea joint. I ordered the teas of the month - passion fruit black tea and caramel milk tea with sugar. Positives: Lots of bubbles. I hate when bbt places skimp on the bubbles even when they are charging for them. Not here! They give plenty of bubbles and they are done right. Texture and taste are a-okay! Negatives: Sugary. I got 30% sugar in the milk tea and 50% sugar in the passion fruit. I thought both were too sweet for my liking. If I went back I would just ask for no sugar in any of my drinks. It's possible they keep the bubbles in syrup so it's adding alot of sugar to the drink. Overall I would say for the price point, I would rather go to a chatime or teashop 168 for my bubble tea. The bubble serving was generous but the tea itself wasn't that great. I prefer the more tea-heavy bubble tea places.

Got the milk tea, it did not have bubbles was kinda suprised you have to pay 50 cents for them. They do have these really cool drink holders, but I had to ask for one even tho the other people before me were given one without requesting it. The tea is actually pretty good. My cup was only 90 percent full tho. Based on all the negatives, slow service, have to pay for bubbles on a standard bubble tea, and the in general poor customer service I would not go back. I am sure allot of this is due to new in-experienced staff, but given how many other places there are in the area there are better options. The tea is really good, but miles about any other major bubble tea brand and I am sure it will be a popular fad for awhile since everyone likes to try new things.","_id":{"$oid":"9ced98d9fcd111ec91e9d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"9bf1863efcd111ec8d47d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Heng-Ling W.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"8\/6\/2020","reviewMessage":"The cheese unicorn was yummy for the tummy and the eyes.

What sets Tika apart from the plethora of bubble tea joints all over Toronto is its cozy, urban vibe. With its airy neutral colour scheme and plenty of natural light, it's a great place to study or relax. But I know you're really interested in the drinks. So here are my thoughts on: - Amber Oolong (signature macchiato): Chunks of real mango add a light, sweet aroma to your typical oolong tea. Delicious with sweet cream. - Imperial Gyokuro (signature macchiato): Delicate oolong. I would say this tea was a bit overpowered by the sweet cream, but yummy nonetheless. - Roasted Pearl Milk Tea: Just your average black milk tea with tapioca; could barely discern any \"roasted\" notes. Directed to enjoy within the hour, but I left it in the fridge overnight and the tapioca balls were still pretty soft and chewy the next morning! So bonus points for that. I tried the Amber Oolong and Imperial Gyokuro signature macchiatos at regular sweetness without toppings, and the Roasted Pearl Milk Tea at 25% sweetness with tapioca balls. Suprisingly, I didn't notice much of a difference in the level of sweetness. Guess the tapioca balls are pretty sweet. I've visited twice since their grand opening, and they were sold out of the Red Dragon Fruit Tea and Cheese Unicorn on both occasions. Would love to try those two drinks when they restock. They had also run out of the toppings I wanted to try: malt and sweet rice. Due to the large menu selection, complexity of drink assembly, and relative inexperience of the fairly new staff, expect a longer wait than you would at a bubble tea chain. I appreciate that the drinks come in recyclable plastic cups, and the straws are packaged in eco-friendly wrappers.","_id":{"$oid":"9eaa1371fcd111ec80c5d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"9bf1863efcd111ec8d47d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Donna F.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"10\/8\/2018","reviewMessage":"I was intrigued when they place boasted that a lot of their (fruit) drinks comprised of a lot of fruit.

Prices are *pretty steep* but worth it for fresh and flavourful tea and fresh fruit. I got the Red Dragon Fruit Tea with 50% sugar and aloe vera and was satisfied with it. It came to almost $8 for the drink with aloe vera for 50 cents extra (like every other bubble tea shop). The cups are pretty cool with the option to sip from a spout but I would imagine it being very difficult to drink it if you got any toppings with it. The only flaw is that the straws have a brown wrapping and it's hard to tell what size the straw is, and there aren't any labels on the boxes. I had a feel for straws in both compartments and they felt the same so I grabbed one and left. The straw was too small for my drink and I had trouble drinking it, which was pretty annoying as blobs of aloe vera plugged the straw and didn't let any liquid through. The size of straw is comparable to the thinner straws you can get at Coco if you get a drink with no topping. While the drink was tasty, it was an absolute pain to drink. I'm not sure if they actually have wider bubble tea straws available, but I really hope they do, or maybe just ran out when I was there? Hopefully they'll put a sign on the straw box or make it more obvious somehow. Either way, the tea had very strong flavour and also reminded me of the tea I usually get at dimsum. Yummy and healthier alternative for the days you just want a refreshing iced tea. I would definitely stop by maybe a couple times a month or if they had any kind of promotion, I'm not sure I could justify the price for this place to be my new go-to.","_id":{"$oid":"9f0bc7f0fcd111ecbbc1d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"9bf1863efcd111ec8d47d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Karmen Y.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"9\/26\/2018","reviewMessage":"Drinks are definitely on the pricier end (~$7 for the fruit teas which are their signature), however totally worth it for the guilty pleasure and novelty factor.

I have only been here once, but the Red Dragon Fruit Tea was amazing. That will definitely be my go-to drink going forward. Get it with 50% sugar - I found that was an appropriate sweetness for me to still enjoy it with the strong tea flavor still penetrating through. And it has real bits of dragonfruit to make the drink that much more enjoyable. Unfortunately you cannot customize the amount of ice, and it is only available in the largest drink size (presumably due to the fruit). I bid goodbye to my usual order of Starbucks Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade Infusion. Worth the splurge if you're in the area. The fruit teas look as good as it tastes (maybe slightly overrated but hey, who doesn't want an Instagram worthy looking drink?). For any tea connoisseurs like myself, you will appreciate that the drinks don't taste like those cheap teas mixed with lots of milk and sugar to mask the taste.

Service: The service was welcoming and friendly. Servers are well informed of the product offerings and they can provide suggestions. Service is fairly quick. Drinks: I went for their signature fruit tea ($6.79). Their fruit teas are quite expensive as it is nearly $10 for a tea. I understand that they are giving real fruit pieces in their fruit teas, but it is still quite a lot for a tea. The tea was just like any other fruit tea I can get from other tea joints, I didn't think it was that special and it didn't justify the high price. I couldn't really taste the tea flavor in the fruit tea since the fruits were overpowering the natural tea flavor, so I can't comment on the tea quality.

No need to travel to Markham for a decent fruit tea, and after an entire summer of obsessing over The Alley down the street, it's refreshing to try something different. I'm a big fan of fruit teas. They're a good choice if you're looking for a healthier option. I prefer to get my drinks with 0% sugar and the drinks still taste decent. Their signature fruit tea is packed with a lot of fruits, so yes that'll add a bit of sugar but the flavoured are much more satisfying than say a La Croix, so I'd say it's worth the few extra calories. I've tried a bunch of drinks from them, and their fruit teas definitely stand out. Their cheese drinks on the other hand weren't all that great - kinda tasted like KoolAid with heavy cream. I personally would recommend the fruit teas for your first time. I've tried their milk pudding as well and it's ok, a little too subtle in the flavours. It's also a bit too small, and as none of the toppings they offer actually compliment the pudding, I would pass on it. The decor of Tika is quite nice. You can tell they really invested a lot into giving it a more Queen St vibe and it's very Instagram-worthy for people into that. The service has always been friendly and efficient, and it's probably one of the few bubble tea shops that greets you when you walk in, I always get kinda startled about that. The one downside to this place is the price. It is a bit pricier than other tea shops, but I think you are paying for better quality. The fruit teas cost about $7 for their one size, but it's satisfying enough that you're not craving for more after you finish it. I'm not a tea connoisseur but even I can tell that their tea leaves are likely not cheap. It is a little expensive, but doesn't feel like a rip off. I didn't think another tea shop would last very long considering all the nearby competition, but so far I have pretty good hopes for this place. It's done a great job differentiating itself from the other shops, offering something a little different from what you see at typical bubble tea shops.

Overall, I think the drinks are pretty good, but a little pricey for what you get - understandable since this is a new place. Random points: * You get your drinks in these very sturdy high quality cups - I feel like you can even reuse them.. I hope they are recyclable.. * The tapioca was a little hard in consistency in my opinion but I liked it. Maybe bc we ordered near the end of the day? Tapioca sometimes didn't go well up the straw and got stuck * The sugar is quite sweet - I ordered my drink with 25% sugar and found it quite sweet still * They've got some cool unique drinks (unicorn cheese, dragonfruit) - be sure to come early in the day if you want to try them out bc they sell out fast * The fresh fruit in the signature fruit tea was indeed very fresh tasting I'd definitely come back to try this place again. Hopefully I can come early enough to try their fast selling drinks!","_id":{"$oid":"a13a133efcd111eca413d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"9f980491fcd111ecbe5ed0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Antonio C.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"9\/5\/2018","reviewMessage":"Brand new bubble tea caf\u00e9 in downtown Toronto! First impressions: clean, stylish, and modern interior, comfortable seating, and friendly staff. They were a bit slow as they're still in a soft opening, but the tea was worth it. I had the Tika Signature Fruit Tea, which unlike of the many artificially sweetened fruit teas full of mass-manufactured processed jellies from your typical big-box bubble tea store, was full of cut-up natural fruits that provided the bbulk of the drinks flavor. After finishing the tea, you can remove the lid and feast on fresh watermelon, oranges, strawberries, grapefruit, lemon, and lime. Would highly recommend this place for any bubble tea lovers in search of a tasty and healthy alternative.","_id":{"$oid":"a160f7cefcd111ecb6a0d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"9f980491fcd111ecbe5ed0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Cherry L.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"7\/18\/2019","reviewMessage":"I love this bubble tea place!

The sweet cream really helped with the flavour.

I had the red jade black tea which is part of their signature macchiato line. The \"macchiato\" is the cream at the top of the drink which is not a typical add on for bubble tea. The cup also comes with instructions that tells you to mix the tea part with the cream. The cream on its own has a slight tang thst reminds me of cream cheese. My friend ordered the signature fresh fruit tea which she enjoyed and is probably a good option if you're not a fan of bubble tea but was somehow dragged to come here because your vote was overruled by majority. Service is a bit slow despite the number of staff working at the back. Will try to come back and try something different. It seems like most people were just picking up the drink on the way home from school or work.","_id":{"$oid":"a2f92549fcd111ec96c6d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"a1885a59fcd111ecac71d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Tuyet Anh \u0110.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"9\/9\/2018","reviewMessage":"TL;DR Soft Opening Beware! Great COLD Machiatos have a cheese foam option (MUST TRY), Taro & Roasted Milk Teas have great flavour & their icecream, sweet rice, & malt (BEST) toppings! MENU DISCLAIMER (SIRENS GOING OFF) They have more items actually but only after their official GRAND OPENING. AND THEY **DO NOT** HAVE THEIR HOT *OR* WARM OPTIONS AT THE MOMENT (yes they are two different options). As well as the Imperial Gyokuro and the Cheese Unicorn and Cheese Mango (sadface). TEA SELECTION (10\/10) They have a vast amount of tea (not the 2 generic bases every bubble tea place has which is some basic form of green tea and black tea) which includes but is not limited to; different types of oolong, black tea, green tea, and two different types of matcha (uji and shizuoka). I highly recommend the Red Jade Black Tea Machiato as it's a light black tea with floral notes if you were to try a machiato (cheese foam is a great combo but fret not they have regular milk foam too). I did not like the Shizuoka Matcha Machiato because it was a very light matcha flavour, the matcha itself has a softer note so opt for Uji if you like the bold matcha flavour as Uji trumps all! However, I do believe Shizuoka is a great option because there are some that like a lighter matcha flavour. MILK TEAS\/BUBBLE TEAS (4\/5) I really loved their Roasted Milk Tea because even though it's not on Formocha's level of authenticity in terms of flavour, you can actually TASTE the roasted flavour. Chatime and Coco boast the same product but tastes just like their regular counterpart. Their taro was also a great taro flavour very surprisingly! I have worked at a bubble tea place before and am very familiar with how sugar dense their liquid or powder forms are but this really just tasted like lightly sweetened taro freshly made and chilled from the stove. The tapioca bubbles are too soft for my liking as I like it slightly chewy, they stuck to my teeth too much. Toppings (4\/5*) Not a vast quanitity but great options other places don't have such as ICECREAM!!! Yay a bubble tea float! Or if you love traditional asian desserts their sweet rice and malt options are right upyour alley and is a must try! They also have milk pudding, aloe vera, red bean, and coconut jelly. NOTE*** The red bean is a little too sweet if those of you don't like sweet options. Service (2.5\/5) I've talked to about three cashiers so far and 2\/3 times their english wasn't that great if you had any big questions with big words or about combinations and drinks. Another 2\/3 times they looked very much like they hated their lives and your existence at the shop and looked quite unhappy and could care less and the atmosphere from them was radiating, \"I would so much rather be at home than here but I need money!!!\" which is understandable because #6sixlife2k18, but at the same time kind of intimidating and made some of my experiences unenjoyable. Just don't expect too much of them caring or looking happy that you're here I guess hahah. ATMOSPHERE\/ENVIRONMENT (3\/5) It's playing those top 50s songs from NA, Southeast Asia, sometimes the occasional country songs (because the boss is in) and I don't think too much of it. The design of the restaurant is very clean and modern with pale yellow lights so it's very photogenic. CONCLUSION I'm really excited to come back after they've pushed through their Soft Opening Phase and everythings actually on the menu as well as their WARM vs HOT option (squeel). Thanks for having me and it seems like the options are great so far, good luck in transitioning to your final phase!!","_id":{"$oid":"a323ef01fcd111ec8bd7d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"a1885a59fcd111ecac71d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Joanne L.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"12\/14\/2018","reviewMessage":"My favorite bubble tea shop for actual drinks with tea.

I'm not sure what I was expecting and I can't complain that there wasn't any dragonfruit taste bc tbh dragonfruit doesn't have much of a scent or taste...it mainly just tastes slightly sweet and refreshing and that's what the the tea delivered. There are dragonfruit chunks so you know that they used real fruits in your tea. The tea is delicious, don't get me wrong, but is it just me or are teashop drinks getting more and more expensive? I just paid $7.22 after tax for a cup of dragonfruit tea, which btw is not the most expensive drink on the menu. I would actually say that this fruit tea is comparable to the ones that Cuppa Tea offers - although Cuppa Tea does not offer exotic fruits in their teas. The fruit teas at Cuppa are just as high quality with the same addictively fragrant and refreshing taste at a slightly lower price point. Tika is a lot more creative in their creations and you get to try some interesting flavours if you value that more. Tika also wins in their decor and ambiance, but Cuppa offers some yummy snacks in case you get hungry. I think it would only be worth it for me to purchase tea at Tika if I were planning on doing some work while enjoying my drink. Or maybe when I'm craving dragonfruit . . .

What sets Tika apart from the plethora of bubble tea joints all over Toronto is its cozy, urban vibe. With its airy neutral colour scheme and plenty of natural light, it's a great place to study or relax. But I know you're really interested in the drinks. So here are my thoughts on: - Amber Oolong (signature macchiato): Chunks of real mango add a light, sweet aroma to your typical oolong tea. Delicious with sweet cream. - Imperial Gyokuro (signature macchiato): Delicate oolong. I would say this tea was a bit overpowered by the sweet cream, but yummy nonetheless. - Roasted Pearl Milk Tea: Just your average black milk tea with tapioca; could barely discern any \"roasted\" notes. Directed to enjoy within the hour, but I left it in the fridge overnight and the tapioca balls were still pretty soft and chewy the next morning! So bonus points for that. I tried the Amber Oolong and Imperial Gyokuro signature macchiatos at regular sweetness without toppings, and the Roasted Pearl Milk Tea at 25% sweetness with tapioca balls. Suprisingly, I didn't notice much of a difference in the level of sweetness. Guess the tapioca balls are pretty sweet. I've visited twice since their grand opening, and they were sold out of the Red Dragon Fruit Tea and Cheese Unicorn on both occasions. Would love to try those two drinks when they restock. They had also run out of the toppings I wanted to try: malt and sweet rice. Due to the large menu selection, complexity of drink assembly, and relative inexperience of the fairly new staff, expect a longer wait than you would at a bubble tea chain.

First impression, call me nostalgic, the cup shape brings back memories of being in China and tasting fruit tea and milk tea at the myriad of tea shops across every city...I need another vacation lol. The Thai iced tea was delicious...saves me a trip from going to Pai or Sabai Sabai. I also tried the Cup O Grapefruit and was a bit disappointed with the taste. There wasn't enough graefruit flavour and it tasted artificial. Not sure if it's suppose to have tea in this drink, but more tea flavour would be nicer.

With my trusty yelp to help guide me, I tried Sharetea before. This time, I was amused by the fat squat cups in the pictures and decided to come here. I think the pictures don't show exactly how HUGE these bigger containers are. It's the same size as the soup take out containers that are meant for a family. I dont know who's drinking this size solo but this might be the first family sized cup I've seen for bubble tea. Though it was crazy big, the prices werent. They had a lot of different offerings as well... sea salt latte, yogurt ones, smoothies, frosted milk, and your regular bubble teas. They also had some unique desserts like \"cheese\" made from rice wine and milk. The spot itself is pretty fairly large for the area. I saw at least 10 tables and on a late Saturday, most tables were taken. They had wifi and some people were just playing games or chatting. It looked pretty clean. Black milk tea with boba - the classic black tea! I stick to this to see how their true tea taste like and this one wasn't as good as the Sharetea across the street. It just tastes more watery and lighter in tea taste. I didn't ask for any ice either so this was a bit of a surprise. With half sweet, I felt the sweetness was good. As for the boba, they're smaller than I'm used to but they seemed to be well cooked. Not too funny and not hard. I just wish it wasn't as watery. 3.5\/5 I have to admit the service was super quick. I got the drink within a few minutes of ordering. I was actually surprised on how quick it was. As for those giant cups ... lol they're crazy.

This place seems too fanciful in terms of their milk tea concoction that it got me staring 10 minutes into the menu and still didn't know what to order. My boyfriend just said. get the simplest ...and that is exactly what I did. Creme Brulee Milk Tea..walked away and didn't know what the hype is, perhaps for others it's the interesting mix and innovativeness in a bubble tea they can get. I think it was about too fanciful and pricier than the born that I am accustomed too. Nevertheless, I can now say.... At least I have tried.","_id":{"$oid":"d9701a07fcd111ecb141d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"d7ec1344fcd111ecbac8d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Cecilia T.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"1\/5\/2021","reviewMessage":"I don't even remember exactly what I had, but I think it was the creme brulee milk tea. I didn't add a topping because I remember thinking it was expensive enough as-is. From that one drink, I've concluded that Machi Machi is just another bbt joint for aesthetics and not for quality. The creme brulee was good and they gave you a lot of it, but the tea didn't have a lot of flavour. I usually get 30% sweet with other bbt shops, but the creme brulee took the sweetness over the top, so I would recommend adjusting sugar levels accordingly. Since my drink was sweeter than I normally take it, it also affected my enjoyment of the drink. Probably won't come back.","_id":{"$oid":"d9b9cce5fcd111ecb34ad0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"d7ec1344fcd111ecbac8d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Daisy W.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"8\/2\/2020","reviewMessage":"I made a trip to the area just to try this bubble tea shop. I first came across is watching J-Style Travels and a colleague told me it's the same Machi Machi as the one in Taiwan. They are known for their cheese foam drinks and since it was my first time visiting, I had to order something from their recommended menu. I ordered their Strawberry Latte with Panna Cotta while my friend ordered the Black Milk Tea with Creme Brulee. The Strawberry Latte came in a cute bottle with the panna cotta sitting in the bottom. I really stirred up the drink before drinking it and loved it. I do not like super sugary drinks, so I was a little concerned when I was told the sugar level was fixed. It ended up being the perfect after dinner treat! My friend said her black milk tea with creme brulee was great too. She said there was actually tea flavour and wasn't too milky. Price point wise, the strawberry latte with panna cotta came up to just over $8, while the black milk tea with creme brulee was a little over $5. The one I ordered was a little steeper in price but is worth a try. I will definitely go back to this cute teashop to try their other drinks.","_id":{"$oid":"da0e2e35fcd111ec8870d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"d7ec1344fcd111ecbac8d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Linda P.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"1\/31\/2022","reviewMessage":"There's so much competition for bubble tea.

That said, I can see why people are bowing down and singing her praises. Even my commoner tastebud recognizes that she is of highest quality. My wife and I got the purple yam with organic milk and brown sugar pearls, and the mango cheese foam with aloe. The toppings (especially the brown sugar pearls) were absolutely regal - amazing taste, great chewy texture, good amount. As for the tea itself, it was fine. I preferred the mango to the purple yam, mainly because I could hardly taste the purple yam. Come to think of it, even the mango was a bit faint. If only their teas had a stronger or more distinct flavour, then I would be one of the Baroness's most loyal constituents. But alas, they don't. And so I will stay on the side as the Baroness waves to her (justifiably) adoring crowds.","_id":{"$oid":"dec45f41fcd111ecb424d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"dd88dad2fcd111ecb810d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Ann Y.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"10\/2\/2021","reviewMessage":"Nice place to hang out (we sat at a table with a swing).

Several of their ingredients are made fresh in-house. They even use organic milk instead of milk. They have oat milk options. The interior is a modern design with tables at least 2 meters apart. This Toronto location (opened Aug 2021) is their second location in Canada. Their first location is in Vancouver (opened fall 2019). Customer service is superb. All the staff are super pleasant giving service with a smile (somehow it shows through their face masks). They are very knowledgeable about the drinks. The Brown Sugar Tapioca is very soft and chewy, thus good quality. The Brown Sugar is made from a special formula. The Purple rice made fresh in-house but the Purple Yam is from powder. The Taro is made fresh in-house. We could definitely taste the smoothness and freshness of the paste. They use organic milk instead of regular milk. The Sunset series uses a fresh egg yolk and blended in the drink. It is a special Taiwanese drink. It is blended with ice making it a slush. The egg yolk is not that noticeable but the main purpose is to make is a smooth taste, which indeed it is. They have clear plastic carrying bags for takeout. The inside of the bag is shaped perfectly to the shape of drink cup so there is no shaking while carrying it. Good idea. During the pandemic, the tables are at least 2 metres apart. Thee is plexiglass at the order counter. The staff are wearing masks. The soft opening was 2021-08-16. During the grand opening on 2021-08-18, the first 88 customers get a free Brown Sugar Pearl Milk Tea and all drinks are 50% off. On 2021-08-16, I happen to be when a couple, customer numbers 1 and 2, were there. They were from Vancouver and were regulars at Baroness in Vancouver.  They raved about the quality of the drinks. Since they moved to Toronto, they could not find any other bubble tea shops of comparable quality! There were so happy Baroness Toronto finally opened. There is free WiFi. The restaurant is wheelchair accessible. The washrooms are gender-neutral and wheelchair accessible. Review 2021-081 You can also find me on Instagram @chuan_chee.

I've had a bunch of different bubble teas from Baroness form the Thai Milk Tea to the Roasted Oolong to the Brown Sugar and they are all amazing and really fragrant. Their boba is also pretty different as they have it warmed up in brown sugar and the boba is a bit sweet while also soft and chewy (whereas a lot of other BBT places just have these chewy and tasteless tapioca pearls that don't really add anything other than texture).

That said, I can see why people are bowing down and singing her praises. Even my commoner tastebud recognizes that she is of highest quality. My wife and I got the purple yam with organic milk and brown sugar pearls, and the mango cheese foam with aloe. The toppings (especially the brown sugar pearls) were absolutely regal - amazing taste, great chewy texture, good amount. As for the tea itself, it was fine. I preferred the mango to the purple yam, mainly because I could hardly taste the purple yam. Come to think of it, even the mango was a bit faint. If only their teas had a stronger or more distinct flavour, then I would be one of the Baroness's most loyal constituents. But alas, they don't. And so I will stay on the side as the Baroness waves to her (justifiably) adoring crowds.","_id":{"$oid":"e731430bfcd111ec9af5d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"e6b19a2afcd111eca7b1d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Melody T.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"8\/25\/2021","reviewMessage":"BEAUTIFUL INTERIOR!

The service was very friendly; as it was my first time here, the tea-rista explained the menu and told us the top drinks to try. As per her recommendation, I ordered the black milk tea with tapioca, with her recommendation of 50% sugar due to the already sweetened brown sugar tapioca pearls. I also ordered a hot peach oolong milk tea with 0% sugar to try as well. When we got the drinks they looked very aesthetic and I was overall impressed! The black milk tea was very fragrant, I really enjoyed the unique flavour of oat milk with black milk tea and the brown sugar tapioca pearls, although the drink was still a tad sweet for me. The tea-rista warned me that the peach oolong milk tea was hot and although I was warned, it was still the hottest drink I've ever gotten from a bubble tea shop. So hot that I had to let it sit for ~15 minutes before I could even try sipping it. As a result, the tapioca turned very soft and lost its chewiness.

My friend and I got their roasted milk tea (w aiyu) and peach oolong mt (also w aiyu) and they both tasted fairly similar (you COULD taste the nuttier aftertaste in the roasted mt).

I initially stumbled upon this brand on Instagram when they had a collaboration with Chibi Maruko Chan a couple years ago (if I remember correctly). They partner with Ritual and was offering $5 off the first order. I ordered their signature fruit tea with 50% sugar and absolutely loved it! It's a really refreshing drink with apples, pineapple and passion fruit. I would totally order this again paying the full price! The decor of their shop was really unique also. Their counter looked like a fruit stall and the menu was on wooden plaques on their wall. They are more of a grab and go location, but they did have three tables there for people to sit in. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.","_id":{"$oid":"f68021f0fcd111ecad80d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"f5f27173fcd111ec845ed0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Shuang W.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"3\/29\/2019","reviewMessage":"After drinking their signature fruit tea for the 10000th time, I am still not sick of it and I want more. The natural sweetness of the fruits will make the tea sweet enough so I drink with 0% of sugar, if u like it sweet, try it with 30% but no more!!! It will cover up the flavor of the fresh fruit and it won't be as good as before. Usually they would give u a fork so in the end when u finish drinking it, open the lid and u can eat all the fruits, I die for the apples inside, especially if I make my fruit tea hot, the warm apple slices in the end makes everything 20000 times better. But hot or cold, up to u, allll amazing.","_id":{"$oid":"f70b8ab1fcd111eca755d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"f5f27173fcd111ec845ed0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Clea C.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"12\/8\/2018","reviewMessage":"Yi Fang is a famous Taiwanese tea chain.

I got it with 70% sugar and regular ice. It was perfect. Not too sweet and the milk tea had great flavor. The best part of the drink was the boba pearls.

I'm a little biased because it reminds me of the bubble tea from this small Taiwanese restaurant I used to visit as a kid before it closed down forever. Some might actually find the taste a little watered down compared to Chatime, CoCo, The Alley, etc. The tapioca here is a bit smaller than usual and they really load it up!
