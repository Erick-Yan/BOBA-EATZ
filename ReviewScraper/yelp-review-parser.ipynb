I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is. It can get really crowded even if you are just getting takeout. There isn't much space for you to stand while waiting for your drink.\",\n",

They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it\\'s worth getting the free card if you think you\\'ll be back in the future. There\\'s also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I\\'ve been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.',\n",

Their grass jelly is slightly sweet, so I usually get no sugar and less ice to no ice.

Right when you enter one you can smell the teas being roasted I LOVE IT! It's the best milk tea I've tasted around although some might argue with me. Line ups at this location is always long reaching to the end of the restaurant, it's around a 10-15 minute wait. I always get it with roasted jelly which is BOMB. I get 30% sugar but recently I've been going with 0% which I honestly think is just fine. Theres still a hint of sweetness from the grass jelly and the flavour is still there. Other drinks I really enjoy is the Oolong milk tea and the taro milk tea, both super good, taro especially. You can tasted the real flavour of the taro and the texture. Although I feel the texture of the taro has been watered down quite a bit since a few years ago.\",\n",

They didn't have enough space inside to accommodate the line and people sitting, as the people in line were literally 5cm from the people sitting. I do give them credit though for moving the line relatively quick. The Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea was really good, and they followed directions with ice and sweetness perfectly.

My go-to is usually the Chatime roasted milk tea, but I tried the roasted tea latte this time around as it was a cold day. Love this tea flavour; strong black tea taste with slightly smoky notes. Reminiscent of one of my favorite teas, lapsang souchong, but not as intense. (Maybe they use some in the tea blend?) Would definitely love to try this again, but iced!',\n",

The cafe itself is always crowded, lacking space for customers to sit down and enjoy the drink.

I have been back several times in the last few weeks and my drink has been consistent every time :) Best pearls in the city, always perfectly sweetened and cooked. I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn\\'t watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn\\'t overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn\\'t see there\\'s an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me.

I love how you can customize the sugar and ice levels. I usually opt out on both since I find the drinks already sufficiently sweet enough and you get a few more sips without the ice. Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste. If you want a cheaper bubble tea you'll be compromising on quality and taste and will probably end up with a sugar laden drink made with some powder or liquid mixture of synthetic flavours.

For whatever reason, it reminds me of VitaSoy's malted soybean milk. Mmm...and I love grass jelly! I took another friend of mine to try their Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly last night. Despite being a rainy Wednesday evening, we still had to wait 20 minutes in line. This little teashop was incredibly crowded. But once I placed our order, it was not long before we received our drinks. The cashier also gave me a reward card last night. You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...) I'm sure I will return because I like the fact that they give you the option to choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, and the Roasted Milk Tea is pretty good.\",\n",

The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea\",\n",

If Iived in Tdot, would definitely come here all the time. - Hazelnut chocolate milk tea with pudding ($4.20 for regular + $0.50 for pudding).

I have walked passed this place several times and I had thought it was an Internet cafe! There was a massive line-up on a Thursday night with young people ready to order from an extensive drink menu. My cousin ordered the caramel milk tea, which she thoroughly enjoyed and I had the refreshing sugar cane juice. There was too much ice in my drink and at $4.20 for a regular size, it was quite expensive. I asked for a small size, but I was given the regular. I haven't seen sugar cane juice widely available in Toronto, so having it here was a nice, unique treat!\",\n",

I got the caramel milk tea (which was 'recommended' on the menu). So delicious! Not artificial/oversweet tasting at all. Drinks are expensive, but not more so than most bubble tea places. You can get a loyalty card which gets you a free drink for every 10. The space is clean and white with some magazines and random quotes about tea written on the back wall. It's a fun place to hang out with friends, and if you get hungry or want some sake, Don Don Izakaya is just upstairs!\",\n",

With the popularity of Chatime amongst late night diners and proximity to Ryerson, it's been a hit for about 6 years and will always be my fave. I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup. Their waiting area is somewhat small so in the summer, id recommend waiting outside and periodically checking in on your order. Drinks were made perfectly and as an alumnus of Chatime, I most certainly miss working with my colleagues. Will be back as I always crave Chatime :)!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'Wait wut? There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don\\'t see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what\\'s so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what\\'s with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn\\'t enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don\\'t even know what you get if you didn\\'t--like what\\'s the default ice and sugar? Let\\'s not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca/\\'boba\\'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they\\'re not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there\\'s a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don\\'t get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn\\'t blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it\\'s the 505 or the Bay bus.}',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I. AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Restaurant: Chatime Bubble Tea Cuisine: Coffee/Tea/Dessert Location: Downtown Toronto Address: 132 Dundas St. W Price Range: ~$10 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5 Extra information: *Wifi Avail *500 Stores WorldWide *Taxes included in the Price *Choose Ice and Sugar Option I've been drinking bbtea for at least last 12 years of my life, and that is A LOT of bbtea and pearls. Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends. Summary: ChaTime reminds me of those bbtea joints back in Vancouver. I will def be back later to try my next fav bbtea flavor, iced honey green tea!!\",\n",

With the popularity of Chatime amongst late night diners and proximity to Ryerson, it's been a hit for about 6 years and will always be my fave. I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup. Their waiting area is somewhat small so in the summer, id recommend waiting outside and periodically checking in on your order. Drinks were made perfectly and as an alumnus of Chatime, I most certainly miss working with my colleagues. Will be back as I always crave Chatime :)!\",\n",

I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is. It can get really crowded even if you are just getting takeout. There isn't much space for you to stand while waiting for your drink.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'The line up, which can sometimes go all the way to the back of the store and wrap back towards the entrance, can get a bit unruly during rush hour, but for bubble tea addicts like me, Chatime is a staple. They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it\\'s worth getting the free card if you think you\\'ll be back in the future. There\\'s also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I\\'ve been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.',\n",

Line ups at this location is always long reaching to the end of the restaurant, it's around a 10-15 minute wait. I always get it with roasted jelly which is BOMB. I get 30% sugar but recently I've been going with 0% which I honestly think is just fine. Theres still a hint of sweetness from the grass jelly and the flavour is still there. Other drinks I really enjoy is the Oolong milk tea and the taro milk tea, both super good, taro especially. You can tasted the real flavour of the taro and the texture.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'I was not a fan of Chatime last year and went off around downtown looking for a go-to bubbletea shop and alas, gave Chatime another try and must withdraw my previous review. I have been back several times in the last few weeks and my drink has been consistent every time :) Best pearls in the city, always perfectly sweetened and cooked. I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn\\'t watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn\\'t overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn\\'t see there\\'s an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me. The wait can be long and stuffy but the staff are efficient. Also, get a Vicinity points card and you can get a free birthday regular drink.',\n",

I love how you can customize the sugar and ice levels. I usually opt out on both since I find the drinks already sufficiently sweet enough and you get a few more sips without the ice. Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste. If you want a cheaper bubble tea you'll be compromising on quality and taste and will probably end up with a sugar laden drink made with some powder or liquid mixture of synthetic flavours.

My friend suggested that I try the Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly. She even specifically told me to order it with less ice and 80% sugar. The taste is pretty interesting and I like it. For whatever reason, it reminds me of VitaSoy's malted soybean milk. Mmm...and I love grass jelly! I took another friend of mine to try their Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly last night. Despite being a rainy Wednesday evening, we still had to wait 20 minutes in line. This little teashop was incredibly crowded. But once I placed our order, it was not long before we received our drinks. The cashier also gave me a reward card last night. You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...) I'm sure I will return because I like the fact that they give you the option to choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, and the Roasted Milk Tea is pretty good.\",\n",

The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea\",\n",

First time that I've ever had grass jelly and really like how they give you the choice of how much sugar you want and even ice!

I ordered it with less ice and 50% sugar, which was perfect. If Iived in Tdot, would definitely come here all the time. - Hazelnut chocolate milk tea with pudding ($4.20 for regular + $0.50 for pudding). Definitely on the sweeter side but the pudding was interesting option to add to my friend's drink. - QQ honeydew milk tea ($4.50 for regular) Great spot.

I tried the fruit ones before but it tasted very generic artificial like other bubble tea shops. Chatime is awesome for letting you choose the ice and sugar level.

I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'Wait wut? There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don\\'t see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what\\'s so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what\\'s with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn\\'t enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don\\'t even know what you get if you didn\\'t--like what\\'s the default ice and sugar? Let\\'s not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca/\\'boba\\'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they\\'re not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there\\'s a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don\\'t get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn\\'t blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it\\'s the 505 or the Bay bus.}',\n",

They have opened up many locations, but my two favourites are at Finch and Richmond Hill. Here we ordered the mango green tea, less sugar, half ice. It was good but not as good as the other two locations. I do give it a thumps up for efficiency, speed, and cost!You should try there top 10 best sellers. You are bound to like one or more of them. My all time favourite is the grass jelly roasted milk tea, less ice, half sugar. Though sometimes I opt for less ice, and less sugar. It depends how I feel. Either way, it is tasty!

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I. AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)\",\n",

Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends. Summary: ChaTime reminds me of those bbtea joints back in Vancouver. I will def be back later to try my next fav bbtea flavor, iced honey green tea!!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"After trying a few of their popular staple bbteas, as well as their seasonal specials...HANDS DOWN The Alley has always served consistent quality & robust flavoured teas with generous toppings. I've loved everything I've had so far! -BLACK SUGAR DEERIOCA (with soymilk): I enjoyed the pre-set sweetness and flavour (which all comes from the tapioca that's freshly cooked with the black sugar). I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic! The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour! I'll keep coming to The Alley especially for their seasonal specials, alternative milk drinks, and I definitely want to try their iron goddess next time! TIP: They have a rewards app program and they do a FREE Birthday drink (but there's a 5 days limit).\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"This was one of the first bubble tea places I tried in Toronto after one of my local friends had been raving about it and it was a fantastic introduction to the area with quick, reliable service. I ordered the original Deerioca with soy milk, since my body violently rejects any amount of lactose, and it was delicious. Keep in mind that while you can customize the ice and sweetness levels on most other drinks, you can only change the type of milk for the Deerioca series. When the cup first touches your hands you are greeted by the warmth of freshly cooked bubbles soaked in a sweet and balanced brown sugar syrup. These bubbles have the perfect amount of chew and bounce and all of them were cooked consistently. The closest comparison I could draw are the bubbles from Boba Guys, which happens to be my favorite bubble tea spot in the states. The brown sugar syrup from the bubbles mixed with the soy milk gave the drink a taste reminiscent of cereal milk, but in my opinion it was delicious nonetheless. However, the drink itself was a tad light and could have used a bit more tea flavor. My friend ordered the Iron Goddess milk tea which had much more of a traditional bubble tea taste so if that's your jam I would recommend ordering from that part of the menu. There is ample seating with a modern wood-cabin aesthetic if you want to grab a delicious drink and get some work done. Overall, a fantastic bubble tea joint that exceeded my expectations and would definitely recommend if you're in the area.\",\n",

Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever.

I\\'ve had the Royal No. 9 which has a blueberry hint, kind of reminded me of a rose tea that didn\\'t taste like your grandma\\'s perfume. Iron Goddess is a flavourful milk tea which I\\'ll usually pair up with tapioca and coffee jelly and the oh so sweet..brown sugar deerioca with soy milk. The tapioca is very sweet and warm but with the freshness from the soy milk, it balances out really well. As pretty as it is, with the syrup drizzle on the side of the cup..I always shake it up really well because all the gooey syrup is at the bottom, it\\'s like sucking up diabetes right there haha. I\\'m just upset it only comes in the smaller size! I took my friend there and she got some sort of lime tea..refreshing but her mistake was agreeing to the lime \"zest\" which were actually lime bits that made it hard for her to drink.

I am not too fussed with paying more for tea, if the tea is indeed richer and has a better flavour profile. The Iron Goddess milk tea was very bland and seemed diluted. You can definitely taste the bluebery notes in No. 9. You can try a sample of it at the counter and what they had was so incredibly sweet. Tapioca was good, not as chewy as Chatime's. Service was okay, I would've expected the drinks to be ready more quickly given the number of staff working. Their cup is sealed with a fancier plastic which looks nice but it doesn't seal well and our drinks spilled. Overall I was hoping to find a new bbt spot to go to, but the search for good bbt continues!\",\n",

Possibly one of my favourites in recent memory but I feel like I need to return to try more to see if it's a 5 star! The Alley sits at the base of a newer building and is a stone's throw away from Yonge st. It's clean, modern, and quite spacious for a place in the heart of Toronto. Unlike other spots on Yonge, It has nice light and higher ceilings. It has a fair amount of seating if you want to enjoy your tea there and even the take out area wouldnt be too crowded since it's wider than the 3 other nearby bubble tea places. The aesthetics is a-dork-able... I think it's so cute. It plays off their 'mascot' which is a reindeer. The antlers and face is peppered about the room. Their takeaway container has the antlers coming out of the cardboard and is used to anchor the string that holds it like a drawstring bag. Im doing it no justice in explaining how adorkable it is... just look at my pics. IT'S SO CUTE! Another great thing about this place... service. Quick, efficient, happy, and completely knowledgeable and full patience to explain their menu. You need that explanation because this isn't your usual powdery regular bubble tea. OH noooo... this is the real deal. Freshly brewed tea with in house made boba that are perfect QQ chewy texture. There are so many different teas to chose from as your base... assam, green tea, iron goddess, jasmine, oolong... you get the idea. They also have several instagram worthy ones that have a lovely gradient of colours. With the super friendly staff, I decided to go with their best seller and totally appreciated the small sample to try before hand.... Royal Tea No.9. Royal Tea No.9 - Explained as a medium strength black tea with blueberry flavour. I remember my first bubble tea actually being a powdery and insanely sugary blueberry bubble tea. I WISHED this was my first bubble tea because this would have gotten me addicted to bubble tea but it'd be a happy addiction! This had a nice mellow black tea flavour that was really clear from the first sip... like a nice mellow English Breakfast. Then the blueberry flavour hits you at the end and it's not a sugary fake scent... this reminded me truly of the fruit! I got mine half sweet and feel thats just the perfect sweetness for me to balance off the natural black tea flavour. I LOVED the pearls! They mentioned they make it in house and it was perfectly chewy and soft. Not overcooked. I can understand why this would be their best seller. Definitely beats all other new spots I've tried recently. 4.5/5 With a huge menu of new and innovative different drinks, I'm loving their offering and it makes me want to come back to try new things. I usually stick to the basics... Roasted or regular black milk tea. Not here! I'm completely sold on their great service, bubble tea, and possibly the cutest thing I've seen in a restaurant in a long time!\",\n",

Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

I wanted something straightforward with a strong tea flavor, so this was recommended to me. Strong tea flavor is right. Nothing is milked down or watered down here.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Been coming here for my bubble tea fix every day of my stay every time I came to Toronto. This is by far the best bubble tea shop I've been to. NY really needs to step up their bubble tea game. Bubble tea shops in NY cheap out on ingredients and toppings even when you're charged for it. The Alley charges for toppings, but they give a decent amount for their drink sizes. There was topping in every sip I took! Royal No. 9 Milk Tea: Tastes like the gummy in Meiji Chocolate Gummy Candy. Not sure if anyone else thinks the same or maybe just me. Sugar level can be adjusted to your preference. Apple of My Eye: Not my cup of bubble tea. It tastes like the Chinese vinegar drink that I'm not fond of. Although, it's quite refreshing after getting used to it. White Peach Oolong: There's no sugar added. The cashier recommended me to add pineapple jelly in it for some texture and sweetness. Thank goodness I trusted her! Great drink after a heavy or salty meal and you just want something to help digest/refresh your mouth. The second time I ordered this, I added pineapple jelly and aloe (best decision ever). Ginger Roasted Milk Tea (only comes in hot & one size): Wished they had a large for this. Has a strong ginger and roasted milk tea taste. If you feel nauseous, don't add any toppings to this drink; the smooth ginger taste will warm up your stomach (According to my mama).\",\n",

Thanks to yelp, I ordered the Royal No. 9 milk tea, my friend had the white peach oolong, and for fun, we ordered their Halloween special, the pumpkin party. I wanted to order the Deerioca too, but they just happen to be sold out. Royal No. 9 milk tea is good, with a slight blueberry aftertaste. The tapioca is well cooked. I'm not personally very fond of blueberries so this drink is not very special for me. The lack of tea taste also really threw me off. However, I can imagine fans of blueberry loving this drink. The white peach oolong looks just like a tea bag in water. I don't know if that justifies the $5 price tag on it. It is actually the pumpkin party drink that I really liked. It is actually much better than a Frappuccino, the sweet pumpkin syrup is out of this world!! I will come back to try their Deerioca one day, but given the higher price tag, I won't come back as a regular. Download their rewards app if you're back often.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'A wonderful place to get tea and other beverages near the University. The first drink I tried was the \"Deerioca\", which consisted of milk and brown sugar. It tasted like any iced milk drink from the usual Asian tea franchises in the states. (e.g. Half and Half, Ten Ren\\'s, Twinkle Twinkle Brown Sugar). The only difference is that the Deerioca does not have a blended ice consistency. Still, I wouldn\\'t call it a truly unique drink, although I certainly enjoyed it. Another thing to note: you cannot adjust the sweetness or ice level for the Deerioca. Also, the drink only comes in the regular size. Keep this in mind if you typically prefer 50% or lower amounts of sweetness in your drinks. The only other drink I\\'ve tried here was the Royal No.9 milk tea. If it weren\\'t for the positive yelp reviews, I probably would not have tried this. I really enjoyed the drink and its unique taste. Basically, it\\'s milk tea with a subtle but delicate blueberry flavor. I\\'ve only been to the Alley 3 times but they always had samples available. I highly recommend this drink. Additionally, various types of toppings are available. I\\'ve tried the boba, which was mediocre but not terrible. Overall, I would give this place 4 stars because I enjoyed the drinks and the atmosphere, which was casual and friendly.',\n",

Anyways, everything about it was just better than all the other bubble tea I\\'ve had before... the quality, the taste, the tapioca. Royal No. 9 seems to be the most popular item to get, but they were sampling the Jasmine Green Milk Tea and it was so good that I think I\\'ll get that one next time. I don\\'t know whether to be glad that it\\'s down the street from my work, because it\\'s so convenient, or if I should be sad because it might be a little too convenient... especially in the summer.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'The downtown is continuing to sprout up bubble tea shops to satisfy the milk tea cravings of the masses. The Alley is another contender that has appeared just south of Yonge and Bloor, hidden inside the lobby level of a condo. How lucky for those condo dwellers! Hanging out here with a few friends in the late evening. Seating is limited to about 15 or so at tables while they have two bars along the walls that can may seat an additional 8 on the high stools. Since it was my first time here, I wanted to try one of their more popular items. After browsing through the menu, I settled for the Royal No 9 milk tea with some tapioca. I normally get less sugar and less ice but I wanted to try it at their regular level to gauge what their take on \"regular\" sweetness would be. The conclusion is that their sweetness is on the lower end of other places but I would still order less sugar and less ice next time around. I really liked the Royal No 9 milk tea. You can taste the steeped tea flavour and not overly mixed with the milk and the sweetener. The tapioca was a nice chewy texture that wasn\\'t overly rubbery. I hear that they make their tapioca fresh and I wonder if that is still the case after being open for quite some time. Their crowd dazzler is their aurora series of drinks which is in a glass jar. It\\'s a swirl of colours that would remind you of the northern lights. No light bulbs needed here. Look forward to being able to try other items on their menu in the future.',\n",

The Bay and Wellesley neighborhood is filled with bubble tea store from China's Happy Lemon, Taiwan's Coco and Sharetea and Green Grotto. As a bubble tea addict, I love all things bubble tea. I always appreciated The Alley's first Canadian location in Richmond Hill. The downtown location has a rustic and modern interior. Sitting is somewhat limited. I opted for the Royal No. 9 milk tea ($5 + 0.5 toppings). The Alley did not disappoint. The tea finishes with a hint of blueberry. Sugar cane syrup is made in house. Tapioca or Deerioca (as they coined it) are made from scratch; kneading and rolling fresh dough into small tapioca balls. With that being said, the tapioca to drink ratio felt slightly off. I wish there was a little more tapioca. Overall, The Alley cost slightly more than other bubble tea stores and charges additional $0.5 for hot drinks. It is well worth the extra $2.\",\n",

A huge reason is because their drinks don\\'t taste as powder-artificial as other bubble tea chains, and they\\'re good at brewing a strong tea. The Royal 9 milk tea has been an Asian hit for years and at this shop it\\'s a blend of black tea and blueberry tea leaves, but I\\'ve recalled having a rose variety. The brown sugar ginger milk tea is very gingery and refreshing, not too sweet despite not being able to adjust the sweetness. You\\'ll feel the zing and heat of the ginger. The purple rice cocoa is a welcomed spin on a hot chocolate that has the soothing quality and rice-y sweetness of purple rice (a popular feature in Thai and Chinese desserts) The \"classic milk tea\" however is rather bland and despite delivering a buzz, left my tea craving unsatisfied. The hojicha soy milk (roasted rice tea, infused in soy milk!) is lightly sweetened, and a great combo. As they\\'re newly opened the service can seem kind of slow and they call out drinks by the receipt number. So don\\'t come here in a rush.',\n",

Now that it's more accessible at a commuter friendly location, I can't wait to try the various flavours. A popular recommendation is the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea and did not disappoint. The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend. I would want to try their Aurora Series next as you get to keep a cute bottle and it has a pretty blend of colours. I'm also keen on trying the Garden Milk Tea since the presentation is cool.

Their top drink is their Royal No.9 milk tea which is a blueberry milk tea. Veeeery good - I totally see why it's their top seller. They usually give out free samples of this drink near the cash register because it's so popular (I always take a sample even though I know how it tastes already, haha). I also tried their northern lights drink, the passion fruit green tea, and their oreo devil slush. All very good. The passion fruit green tea isn't as great as other tea shops I've been to but it's decent! And the northern lights drink isn't too bad.. tastes like freshly juiced grapes and looks like a cool little galaxy in a bottle - you get a nice little bottle too! The place is quite aesthetic looking with nice decor but has limited seats. There's still long lines occasionally since it just opened - come at non-peak hours or near closing to avoid the lines. I'm a fan! Definitely try that Royal No.9!\",\n",

I absolutely loved the interior decor, much more modern and sophisticated than your average store. There's enough seating for 12-15 people, the main area is quite spacious so you can wait for your order without suffering a bout of claustrophobia, the preparation/kitchen area is kept immaculate, staffs are polite and helpful, superior selections of tea that you'll mainly see at brewed-to-order cafes. Prices are reasonable, though everything in Toronto seems to rival prices of more expensive parts of nyc. We ordered an iced hojicha latte (with bubbles) and their alley trio bubble tea. Hojicha - I love hojicha, my favourite tea of all teas so I had high expectations after being disappointed with boba guys. I can't say these guys delivered on that front either, the hojicha flavour came through but was SUPER concentrated, even the colour (after being mixed in with the milk thoroughly) was 10 shades too dark. I recommend getting it less sweet as it was overwhelmingly sweet, add the sugar from the bubbles and it was hard for me to finish. **sigggghhhh** just disappointing :( Trio bubble milk tea - it was just classic milk tea, 'trio' referring to the 3 types of toppings which were pearls/jelly and something else I can't remember. We ordered it to be less sweet, thank god we did because the sugar from the toppings gave it the perfect amount of sweetness. I was very pleased with this one, and would recommend others give it a go. If anything, stop by to enjoy a decent bubble tea and nice cafe with good atmosphere.\",\n",

Of course, I hyped myself up with high expectations and was not looking to be disappointed. The Alley was quite away from my hotel but in the end, it was worth the walk! I was not disappointed. This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip.

I'm usually not one to get milk teas (I prefer fruity), so I'm pretty surprised at how I've been sucked into their milk teas! So far, I've tried Deerioca Fever, Trio Milk Tea, and Royal No.9. I've to say, Royal No.9 is my favourite of the three - it is light with a hint of blueberry after taste, very different from other milk teas. The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about. Would definitely recommend trying this spot! TIP: download their app. Every drink gets you a point. You can get a free drink after 10 points!\",\n",

And other decorations along the walls. Ordered the Trio Milk Tea which comes with tapioca, rainbow jelly, and something else, which is not bad cause toppings are 50 cents each and you\\'re basically spending an extra 50 cents to get classic milk tea with three toppings. I\\'m ok with the basic stuff so it works out for me. Other places also offer their own \"triple topping\" combos but I think the rainbow jelly was a good choice cause it provided some fruity flavors. BBT prices have been steadily going up and the prices here are probably just a bit higher than most places (and not much either you\\'re looking at maybe a quarter or two?) I would definitely prefer bringing people here, simply because of the overall atmosphere.',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Prior to visiting Toronto, I made a note to myself that I would visit The Alley to grab some bubble tea. I've had bubble tea from the west coast of the US, east coast of the US, and now it was time to try Canadian bubble tea. I was pleasantly surprised! After walking for hours at the Royal Ontario Museum; I hopped into a uber and stopped by The Alley. My first impression was that this cafe was super cute and had so many drink options! I was going to get the cute Aurora Series drinks at first, but they take 30 minutes to make so I passed on that. I ended up getting the Alley Trio (consists of milk tea w/ 3 toppings) and their bestseller the Royal No.9 (milk tea with blue berry!) I loved the flavors of both drinks and was highly considering getting another one (but I had to eat dinner so I didn't). If you opt to get a hot drink, you get a cute cup with a deer shaped cup holder. I would be lying if I said I didn't order the hot drink just for the cup holder (haha). The people working at The Alley were accommodating and took the time to answer any questions I had. Oh I wish they would open one in NYC!\",\n",

When I heard that The Alley opened up in downtown toronto, and near my work place, I was like \"OH NO, there\\'s already a Coco, HappyLemon, and Sharetea all around the same block.\" But, the good thing is, they\\'re all unique and offer different tastes of teas. Honestly, when I visited The Alley in markham a couple months ago, I did not enjoy it (maybe because of the drink I ordered: Trio milk tea). This time, I ordered the, all famous, ROYAL NO. 9! I could really taste the hint of blueberry! Will definitely come again for the drink! As per those who are thinking of getting their trio milk tea, if you like coconut/fruit jelly in your milk tea, by all means ~ but if you\\'re someone who doesn\\'t mix well with a combination of fruits, milk and tea - I might tell you to avoid it and try something else - it is definitely a more adventurous pick!!

       "  'reviewMessage': \"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

I've loved everything I've had so far! -BLACK SUGAR DEERIOCA (with soymilk): I enjoyed the pre-set sweetness and flavour (which all comes from the tapioca that's freshly cooked with the black sugar). I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic! The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour! I'll keep coming to The Alley especially for their seasonal specials, alternative milk drinks, and I definitely want to try their iron goddess next time!

       "  'reviewMessage': 'On a scale of one to ten; how in love with bubble tea are you? The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It\\'s a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I\\'m pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That\\'s how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they\\'re always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you\\'re in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there\\'s all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley\\'s Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they\\'re famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley\\'s signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow\\'s milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you\\'ll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn\\'t get more solid. I\\'d been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn\\'t described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don\\'t just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn\\'t quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I\\'m not sure what I expected, but what I r',\n",

Like most yelpers said has a blueberry undertone that you would not get at other bubble tea shops. Atmosphere/service: The washroom is wheelchair accessible, major bonus. The decor is rustic reinforcing their brand. There is some seating but a nice social space to have a chat with friends. Price: $5-7, in line with most premium bubble tea shops.

I went there after lunch on a weekday afternoon hoping to get some work done and grab some good drinks too at the same time, and needless to say, I was not disappointed. This place is located near UofT downtown campus, which can maybe make the place crowded. Fortunately, at the time where I went, which was on a weekday during vacations, I was able to easily find a table to settle myself. As for the drinks, there are various interesting choices from which you can choose. I went for the Brown Sugar Deerioca. It was suggested for me and it was also a plus since there was no actual tea (I sometimes have trouble sleeping at night if I drink coffee or tea on afternoons lol). The drink itself was fantastic! The drink consisted of, from what I can gather, of the bubbles, brown sugar and milk. The mix might sound uninteresting but I can assure you, it was easily one of the best drinks I ever had.

You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended!

       "  'reviewMessage': 'I\\'ve been going every week to fix my bubble tea craving haha. I\\'m happy it\\'s close to my work out studio and use it as an excuse to treat myself to one of their milk teas! I\\'ve had the Royal No. 9 which has a blueberry hint, kind of reminded me of a rose tea that didn\\'t taste like your grandma\\'s perfume. Iron Goddess is a flavourful milk tea which I\\'ll usually pair up with tapioca and coffee jelly and the oh so sweet..brown sugar deerioca with soy milk. The tapioca is very sweet and warm but with the freshness from the soy milk, it balances out really well. As pretty as it is, with the syrup drizzle on the side of the cup..I always shake it up really well because all the gooey syrup is at the bottom, it\\'s like sucking up diabetes right there haha. I\\'m just upset it only comes in the smaller size! I took my friend there and she got some sort of lime tea..refreshing but her mistake was agreeing to the lime \"zest\" which were actually lime bits that made it hard for her to drink. She sure had fun picking those bits out of her mouth hehe.',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I had a really good experience at The Alley. My friend and I came here for a drink and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end. The ambiance in the restaurant is warm and cozy. The restaurant has a nice feeling and all of the employees are really friendly, helpful and kind. Before I placed my order, I told the employee I was both gluten and lactose intolerant. The two employees working at the counter recommended I try the Brown Sugar Deerioca or the ginger sweet tea since I had a sore throat. I decided to order the Brown Sugar Deerioca beverage to enjoy at the restaurant and I ended up getting the Sweet Ginger Tea to-go. When I received the Brown Sugar Deerioca, it was presented in three beautiful layers. The dark coloured tapioca was prominent at the bottom of the cup and a rich caramel colour was above it with a creamy white colour on top. I mixed the three layers together and will try my best to describe the amazing flavour of this drink. The tapioca was fresh, warm and chewy; I could tell it had just been cooked. The flavour of the brown sugar layer and the almond milk layer were fantastic! It tasted like a sugar syrup you would bake on the stove yet it also kind of reminded me of cotton candy. It made my mind think of a delicious caramel sauce. The flavour pallet of this bubble tea was beyond any type I have tried in the past. It was definitely an experience and I highly recommend you check it out too. Ginger Sweet Tea To-Go! The sweet ginger tea tasted really good and definitely helped soothe my sore throat. If you're feeling a bit under the weather this would definitely help you. Now for the ICING on the CAKE! My to-go drink had a special touch most restaurants do not have. My to-go cup was served with a deer sleeve that had a strap that allows guests to carry their beverage out of the store without burning their hands. The drink sleeve had a handle. It was the most adorable drink sleeve I have ever used and I hope more restaurants start implementing sleeves like this. It is very creative and innovative. To see what it looks like, find my photo. In Summary: ... I would definitely return to this bubble tea restaurant when in the area. Tip: Make sure you get their loyalty card.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"The Alley is becoming one of my favourite bubble tea places, having been here a number of times and tried many of their drinks. Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'On a scale of one to ten; how in love with bubble tea are you? The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It\\'s a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I\\'m pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That\\'s how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they\\'re always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you\\'re in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there\\'s all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley\\'s Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they\\'re famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley\\'s signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow\\'s milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you\\'ll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn\\'t get more solid. I\\'d been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn\\'t described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don\\'t just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn\\'t quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I\\'m not sure what I expected, but what I r',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Ambience 4.5/5: Laid-back, moose-decorated hipsterish cafe. Very relaxed, with outlets along the window. More space than the usual boba place. Appearance 5/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

I'm usually not one to get milk teas (I prefer fruity), so I'm pretty surprised at how I've been sucked into their milk teas! So far, I've tried Deerioca Fever, Trio Milk Tea, and Royal No.9. I've to say, Royal No.9 is my favourite of the three - it is light with a hint of blueberry after taste, very different from other milk teas. The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about.

The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great!

I got literally way too excited when knowing Toronto has several The Alley locations since my boba tea addiction is no joke. The first thing I would try here is Brown sugar deerioca fever with fresh milk. It was just best of the best! You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended! It also came in a very cute bottle. The only thing I did not like nor anticipate is parking. It's located underneath the condos and parallel parking there was a hassle.\",\n",

The service was quite fast and the staff were really friendly. One thing they need to improve though is the queue for the line. It's kind of all over the place. This time I decided on a jasmine green milk tea (with no sugar). It was really refreshing and so tasty! You really can taste the quality of tea that they brew unlike other places which just use powders. Deerioca is also an amazing drink here, and Royal No. 9. In all, this Alley is a solid spot!\",\n",

At first I thought \"it\\'s just bubble tea, how good can it be?\" But then I tried it. And I realized why she was talking in all caps. And also why I will never question her again. The tea was amazing and made within a couple minutes, the service was great, and inside is just a nice place to hang out - it\\'s a cool atmosphere with the brick walls and all the stringed lights. AND they even give free samples! I got the the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea (as instructed to by my friend), and I was in love after the first sip (love at first sip... that\\'s a thing right?). Anyways, everything about it was just better than all the other bubble tea I\\'ve had before... the quality, the taste, the tapioca. Royal No. 9 seems to be the most popular item to get, but they were sampling the Jasmine Green Milk Tea and it was so good that I think I\\'ll get that one next time. I don\\'t know whether to be glad that it\\'s down the street from my work, because it\\'s so convenient, or if I should be sad because it might be a little too convenient... especially in the summer. Anyway, if someone suggests this to you, DON\\'T DOUBT, JUST GO!',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"The Alley is becoming one of my favourite bubble tea places, having been here a number of times and tried many of their drinks. Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

Now that it's more accessible at a commuter friendly location, I can't wait to try the various flavours. A popular recommendation is the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea and did not disappoint. The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend. I would want to try their Aurora Series next as you get to keep a cute bottle and it has a pretty blend of colours. I'm also keen on trying the Garden Milk Tea since the presentation is cool.

The tea has a hint of blueberry, a bit fruity which I really enjoy. + The tapioca was not sweet enough, but I like its chewy texture tho - Portion: comes in regular size and large size, did not give enough tapioca tho, I might order 2 toppings next time.

Value 3/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!!

Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"One of the better spots I've tried! Their drink list is extensive categorized from milk tea to fresh milk to fruit teas. The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great! I definitely recommend trying this spot.\",\n",

While the Alley is pricier than most areas, I firmly believe the increase in price is well worth it. The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever. Honestly, there's no item on the menu I wouldn't recommend trying out at least once. Although it is very far from where I live, the ride on the subway is one I'd be willing to take just for this great place.\",\n",

Their top drink is their Royal No.9 milk tea which is a blueberry milk tea. Veeeery good - I totally see why it's their top seller. They usually give out free samples of this drink near the cash register because it's so popular (I always take a sample even though I know how it tastes already, haha). I also tried their northern lights drink, the passion fruit green tea, and their oreo devil slush. All very good. The passion fruit green tea isn't as great as other tea shops I've been to but it's decent! And the northern lights drink isn't too bad.. tastes like freshly juiced grapes and looks like a cool little galaxy in a bottle - you get a nice little bottle too! The place is quite aesthetic looking with nice decor but has limited seats. There's still long lines occasionally since it just opened - come at non-peak hours or near closing to avoid the lines. I'm a fan! Definitely try that Royal No.9!\",\n",

I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic! The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour!

This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"One of the better spots I've tried! Their drink list is extensive categorized from milk tea to fresh milk to fruit teas. The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great! I definitely recommend trying this spot.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

I've had bubble tea from the west coast of the US, east coast of the US, and now it was time to try Canadian bubble tea. I was pleasantly surprised! After walking for hours at the Royal Ontario Museum; I hopped into a uber and stopped by The Alley. My first impression was that this cafe was super cute and had so many drink options! I was going to get the cute Aurora Series drinks at first, but they take 30 minutes to make so I passed on that. I ended up getting the Alley Trio (consists of milk tea w/ 3 toppings) and their bestseller the Royal No.9 (milk tea with blue berry!) I loved the flavors of both drinks and was highly considering getting another one (but I had to eat dinner so I didn't). If you opt to get a hot drink, you get a cute cup with a deer shaped cup holder. I would be lying if I said I didn't order the hot drink just for the cup holder (haha). The people working at The Alley were accommodating and took the time to answer any questions I had. Oh I wish they would open one in NYC!\",\n",

However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it\\'s worth getting the free card if you think you\\'ll be back in the future. There\\'s also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I\\'ve been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.',\n",

They were surprised at how busy it was and automatically had high hopes for this place, and they were not disappointed. It was almost 11pm and there were still lines winding throughout the store. I honestly think they should consider expanding their store as they were so busy. They didn't have enough space inside to accommodate the line and people sitting, as the people in line were literally 5cm from the people sitting. I do give them credit though for moving the line relatively quick. The Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea was really good, and they followed directions with ice and sweetness perfectly. I suggest if you're a first timer like my friends, you won't go wrong with ordering from their top 10 menu.\",\n",

I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn\\'t watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn\\'t overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn\\'t see there\\'s an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me.

I love how you can customize the sugar and ice levels. I usually opt out on both since I find the drinks already sufficiently sweet enough and you get a few more sips without the ice. Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste. If you want a cheaper bubble tea you'll be compromising on quality and taste and will probably end up with a sugar laden drink made with some powder or liquid mixture of synthetic flavours.

For whatever reason, it reminds me of VitaSoy's malted soybean milk. Mmm...and I love grass jelly! I took another friend of mine to try their Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly last night. Despite being a rainy Wednesday evening, we still had to wait 20 minutes in line. This little teashop was incredibly crowded. But once I placed our order, it was not long before we received our drinks. The cashier also gave me a reward card last night. You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...) I'm sure I will return because I like the fact that they give you the option to choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, and the Roasted Milk Tea is pretty good.\",\n",

The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea\",\n",

If Iived in Tdot, would definitely come here all the time. - Hazelnut chocolate milk tea with pudding ($4.20 for regular + $0.50 for pudding).

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I'm a huge fan of Chatime! My favourite thing about this Dundas location is that the staff are super quick at taking your order and making drinks. The lines are always long around meal time and post-meal time but I never had to wait for too long to get my drink. Top flavours in my opinion have got to be the milk teas. Roasted milk tea, brown rice green tea, caramel milk tea, taro milk tea, all are my frequent options because so much flavour is packed in in one drink. I tried the fruit ones before but it tasted very generic artificial like other bubble tea shops. Chatime is awesome for letting you choose the ice and sugar level. I don't like my drink too cold or sweet so I always ask for less sugar and no ice. TIP: Don't forget to ask for a stamp card if you don't have one already! I know that once you check out Chatime you'll be going back for more.\",\n",

My cousin ordered the caramel milk tea, which she thoroughly enjoyed and I had the refreshing sugar cane juice. There was too much ice in my drink and at $4.20 for a regular size, it was quite expensive. I asked for a small size, but I was given the regular.

With the popularity of Chatime amongst late night diners and proximity to Ryerson, it's been a hit for about 6 years and will always be my fave. I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup. Their waiting area is somewhat small so in the summer, id recommend waiting outside and periodically checking in on your order. Drinks were made perfectly and as an alumnus of Chatime, I most certainly miss working with my colleagues. Will be back as I always crave Chatime :)!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'Wait wut? There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don\\'t see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what\\'s so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what\\'s with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn\\'t enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don\\'t even know what you get if you didn\\'t--like what\\'s the default ice and sugar? Let\\'s not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca/\\'boba\\'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they\\'re not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there\\'s a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don\\'t get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn\\'t blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it\\'s the 505 or the Bay bus.}',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I. AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)\",\n",

Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends. Summary: ChaTime reminds me of those bbtea joints back in Vancouver. I will def be back later to try my next fav bbtea flavor, iced honey green tea!!\",\n",

With the popularity of Chatime amongst late night diners and proximity to Ryerson, it's been a hit for about 6 years and will always be my fave. I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup. Their waiting area is somewhat small so in the summer, id recommend waiting outside and periodically checking in on your order. Drinks were made perfectly and as an alumnus of Chatime, I most certainly miss working with my colleagues. Will be back as I always crave Chatime :)!\",\n",

I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is. It can get really crowded even if you are just getting takeout. There isn't much space for you to stand while waiting for your drink.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'The line up, which can sometimes go all the way to the back of the store and wrap back towards the entrance, can get a bit unruly during rush hour, but for bubble tea addicts like me, Chatime is a staple. They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it\\'s worth getting the free card if you think you\\'ll be back in the future. There\\'s also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I\\'ve been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.',\n",

This time, we got one regular pearl milk tea and one matcha green tea milk tea with tapioca. Considering how hyped Toronto is with matcha these days, this matcha green tea felt like it was lacking a bit of that strong matcha taste. The cafe itself is always crowded, lacking space for customers to sit down and enjoy the drink. It is always very humid: makes me wonder what the staffs' discomfort index would be -although, their skin looked all great, must be benefitting from all that moisture.

Their toppings are always on point. The Tea of the Months are pretty hit or miss. The slushes are pretty weak, just avoid them and go with their great milk teas.

I have been back several times in the last few weeks and my drink has been consistent every time :) Best pearls in the city, always perfectly sweetened and cooked. I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn\\'t watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn\\'t overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn\\'t see there\\'s an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me. The wait can be long and stuffy but the staff are efficient. Also, get a Vicinity points card and you can get a free birthday regular drink.',\n",

I love how you can customize the sugar and ice levels. I usually opt out on both since I find the drinks already sufficiently sweet enough and you get a few more sips without the ice. Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste. If you want a cheaper bubble tea you'll be compromising on quality and taste and will probably end up with a sugar laden drink made with some powder or liquid mixture of synthetic flavours.

My friend suggested that I try the Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly. She even specifically told me to order it with less ice and 80% sugar. The taste is pretty interesting and I like it. For whatever reason, it reminds me of VitaSoy's malted soybean milk. Mmm...and I love grass jelly! I took another friend of mine to try their Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly last night. Despite being a rainy Wednesday evening, we still had to wait 20 minutes in line. This little teashop was incredibly crowded. But once I placed our order, it was not long before we received our drinks. The cashier also gave me a reward card last night. You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...) I'm sure I will return because I like the fact that they give you the option to choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, and the Roasted Milk Tea is pretty good.\",\n",

The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea\",\n",

If Iived in Tdot, would definitely come here all the time. - Hazelnut chocolate milk tea with pudding ($4.20 for regular + $0.50 for pudding).

I tried the fruit ones before but it tasted very generic artificial like other bubble tea shops. Chatime is awesome for letting you choose the ice and sugar level.

It's a fun place to hang out with friends, and if you get hungry or want some sake, Don Don Izakaya is just upstairs!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"This OG store needs to be expanded! With the popularity of Chatime amongst late night diners and proximity to Ryerson, it's been a hit for about 6 years and will always be my fave. I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup. Their waiting area is somewhat small so in the summer, id recommend waiting outside and periodically checking in on your order. Drinks were made perfectly and as an alumnus of Chatime, I most certainly miss working with my colleagues. Will be back as I always crave Chatime :)!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'Wait wut? There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don\\'t see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what\\'s so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what\\'s with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn\\'t enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don\\'t even know what you get if you didn\\'t--like what\\'s the default ice and sugar? Let\\'s not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca/\\'boba\\'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they\\'re not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there\\'s a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don\\'t get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn\\'t blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it\\'s the 505 or the Bay bus.}',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I. AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)\",\n",

Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends. Summary: ChaTime reminds me of those bbtea joints back in Vancouver. I will def be back later to try my next fav bbtea flavor, iced honey green tea!!\",\n",

With the popularity of Chatime amongst late night diners and proximity to Ryerson, it's been a hit for about 6 years and will always be my fave. I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup. Their waiting area is somewhat small so in the summer, id recommend waiting outside and periodically checking in on your order. Drinks were made perfectly and as an alumnus of Chatime, I most certainly miss working with my colleagues. Will be back as I always crave Chatime :)!\",\n",

I've loved everything I've had so far! -BLACK SUGAR DEERIOCA (with soymilk): I enjoyed the pre-set sweetness and flavour (which all comes from the tapioca that's freshly cooked with the black sugar). I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic! The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour! I'll keep coming to The Alley especially for their seasonal specials, alternative milk drinks, and I definitely want to try their iron goddess next time! TIP: They have a rewards app program and they do a FREE Birthday drink (but there's a 5 days limit).\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"This was one of the first bubble tea places I tried in Toronto after one of my local friends had been raving about it and it was a fantastic introduction to the area with quick, reliable service. I ordered the original Deerioca with soy milk, since my body violently rejects any amount of lactose, and it was delicious. Keep in mind that while you can customize the ice and sweetness levels on most other drinks, you can only change the type of milk for the Deerioca series. When the cup first touches your hands you are greeted by the warmth of freshly cooked bubbles soaked in a sweet and balanced brown sugar syrup. These bubbles have the perfect amount of chew and bounce and all of them were cooked consistently. The closest comparison I could draw are the bubbles from Boba Guys, which happens to be my favorite bubble tea spot in the states. The brown sugar syrup from the bubbles mixed with the soy milk gave the drink a taste reminiscent of cereal milk, but in my opinion it was delicious nonetheless. However, the drink itself was a tad light and could have used a bit more tea flavor. My friend ordered the Iron Goddess milk tea which had much more of a traditional bubble tea taste so if that's your jam I would recommend ordering from that part of the menu. There is ample seating with a modern wood-cabin aesthetic if you want to grab a delicious drink and get some work done. Overall, a fantastic bubble tea joint that exceeded my expectations and would definitely recommend if you're in the area.\",\n",

Appearance 5/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

I am not too fussed with paying more for tea, if the tea is indeed richer and has a better flavour profile. The Iron Goddess milk tea was very bland and seemed diluted. You can definitely taste the bluebery notes in No. 9. You can try a sample of it at the counter and what they had was so incredibly sweet. Tapioca was good, not as chewy as Chatime's. Service was okay, I would've expected the drinks to be ready more quickly given the number of staff working. Their cup is sealed with a fancier plastic which looks nice but it doesn't seal well and our drinks spilled.

Possibly one of my favourites in recent memory but I feel like I need to return to try more to see if it's a 5 star! The Alley sits at the base of a newer building and is a stone's throw away from Yonge st. It's clean, modern, and quite spacious for a place in the heart of Toronto. Unlike other spots on Yonge, It has nice light and higher ceilings. It has a fair amount of seating if you want to enjoy your tea there and even the take out area wouldnt be too crowded since it's wider than the 3 other nearby bubble tea places. The aesthetics is a-dork-able... I think it's so cute. It plays off their 'mascot' which is a reindeer. The antlers and face is peppered about the room. Their takeaway container has the antlers coming out of the cardboard and is used to anchor the string that holds it like a drawstring bag. Im doing it no justice in explaining how adorkable it is... just look at my pics. IT'S SO CUTE! Another great thing about this place... service. Quick, efficient, happy, and completely knowledgeable and full patience to explain their menu. You need that explanation because this isn't your usual powdery regular bubble tea. OH noooo... this is the real deal. Freshly brewed tea with in house made boba that are perfect QQ chewy texture. There are so many different teas to chose from as your base... assam, green tea, iron goddess, jasmine, oolong... you get the idea. They also have several instagram worthy ones that have a lovely gradient of colours. With the super friendly staff, I decided to go with their best seller and totally appreciated the small sample to try before hand.... Royal Tea No.9. Royal Tea No.9 - Explained as a medium strength black tea with blueberry flavour. I remember my first bubble tea actually being a powdery and insanely sugary blueberry bubble tea. I WISHED this was my first bubble tea because this would have gotten me addicted to bubble tea but it'd be a happy addiction! This had a nice mellow black tea flavour that was really clear from the first sip... like a nice mellow English Breakfast. Then the blueberry flavour hits you at the end and it's not a sugary fake scent... this reminded me truly of the fruit! I got mine half sweet and feel thats just the perfect sweetness for me to balance off the natural black tea flavour. I LOVED the pearls! They mentioned they make it in house and it was perfectly chewy and soft. Not overcooked. I can understand why this would be their best seller. Definitely beats all other new spots I've tried recently. 4.5/5 With a huge menu of new and innovative different drinks, I'm loving their offering and it makes me want to come back to try new things. I usually stick to the basics... Roasted or regular black milk tea. Not here! I'm completely sold on their great service, bubble tea, and possibly the cutest thing I've seen in a restaurant in a long time!\",\n",

Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

I wanted something straightforward with a strong tea flavor, so this was recommended to me. Strong tea flavor is right. Nothing is milked down or watered down here.

The drinks we ordered were the Royal no. 9 milk tea Iron goddess milk tea. The iron goddess is a type of oolong tea on the stronger side.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Ambience 4.5/5: Laid-back, moose-decorated hipsterish cafe. Very relaxed, with outlets along the window. More space than the usual boba place. Appearance 5/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Been coming here for my bubble tea fix every day of my stay every time I came to Toronto. This is by far the best bubble tea shop I've been to. NY really needs to step up their bubble tea game. Bubble tea shops in NY cheap out on ingredients and toppings even when you're charged for it. The Alley charges for toppings, but they give a decent amount for their drink sizes. There was topping in every sip I took! Royal No. 9 Milk Tea: Tastes like the gummy in Meiji Chocolate Gummy Candy. Not sure if anyone else thinks the same or maybe just me. Sugar level can be adjusted to your preference. Apple of My Eye: Not my cup of bubble tea. It tastes like the Chinese vinegar drink that I'm not fond of. Although, it's quite refreshing after getting used to it. White Peach Oolong: There's no sugar added. The cashier recommended me to add pineapple jelly in it for some texture and sweetness. Thank goodness I trusted her! Great drink after a heavy or salty meal and you just want something to help digest/refresh your mouth. The second time I ordered this, I added pineapple jelly and aloe (best decision ever). Ginger Roasted Milk Tea (only comes in hot & one size): Wished they had a large for this. Has a strong ginger and roasted milk tea taste. If you feel nauseous, don't add any toppings to this drink; the smooth ginger taste will warm up your stomach (According to my mama).\",\n",

Thanks to yelp, I ordered the Royal No. 9 milk tea, my friend had the white peach oolong, and for fun, we ordered their Halloween special, the pumpkin party. I wanted to order the Deerioca too, but they just happen to be sold out. Royal No. 9 milk tea is good, with a slight blueberry aftertaste. The tapioca is well cooked. I'm not personally very fond of blueberries so this drink is not very special for me. The lack of tea taste also really threw me off. However, I can imagine fans of blueberry loving this drink. The white peach oolong looks just like a tea bag in water. I don't know if that justifies the $5 price tag on it. It is actually the pumpkin party drink that I really liked. It is actually much better than a Frappuccino, the sweet pumpkin syrup is out of this world!! I will come back to try their Deerioca one day, but given the higher price tag, I won't come back as a regular. Download their rewards app if you're back often.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'A wonderful place to get tea and other beverages near the University. The first drink I tried was the \"Deerioca\", which consisted of milk and brown sugar. It tasted like any iced milk drink from the usual Asian tea franchises in the states. (e.g. Half and Half, Ten Ren\\'s, Twinkle Twinkle Brown Sugar). The only difference is that the Deerioca does not have a blended ice consistency. Still, I wouldn\\'t call it a truly unique drink, although I certainly enjoyed it. Another thing to note: you cannot adjust the sweetness or ice level for the Deerioca. Also, the drink only comes in the regular size. Keep this in mind if you typically prefer 50% or lower amounts of sweetness in your drinks. The only other drink I\\'ve tried here was the Royal No.9 milk tea. If it weren\\'t for the positive yelp reviews, I probably would not have tried this. I really enjoyed the drink and its unique taste. Basically, it\\'s milk tea with a subtle but delicate blueberry flavor. I\\'ve only been to the Alley 3 times but they always had samples available. I highly recommend this drink. Additionally, various types of toppings are available. I\\'ve tried the boba, which was mediocre but not terrible. Overall, I would give this place 4 stars because I enjoyed the drinks and the atmosphere, which was casual and friendly.',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'The downtown is continuing to sprout up bubble tea shops to satisfy the milk tea cravings of the masses. The Alley is another contender that has appeared just south of Yonge and Bloor, hidden inside the lobby level of a condo. How lucky for those condo dwellers! Hanging out here with a few friends in the late evening. Seating is limited to about 15 or so at tables while they have two bars along the walls that can may seat an additional 8 on the high stools. Since it was my first time here, I wanted to try one of their more popular items. After browsing through the menu, I settled for the Royal No 9 milk tea with some tapioca. I normally get less sugar and less ice but I wanted to try it at their regular level to gauge what their take on \"regular\" sweetness would be. The conclusion is that their sweetness is on the lower end of other places but I would still order less sugar and less ice next time around. I really liked the Royal No 9 milk tea. You can taste the steeped tea flavour and not overly mixed with the milk and the sweetener. The tapioca was a nice chewy texture that wasn\\'t overly rubbery. I hear that they make their tapioca fresh and I wonder if that is still the case after being open for quite some time. Their crowd dazzler is their aurora series of drinks which is in a glass jar. It\\'s a swirl of colours that would remind you of the northern lights. No light bulbs needed here. Look forward to being able to try other items on their menu in the future.',\n",

The Bay and Wellesley neighborhood is filled with bubble tea store from China's Happy Lemon, Taiwan's Coco and Sharetea and Green Grotto. As a bubble tea addict, I love all things bubble tea. I always appreciated The Alley's first Canadian location in Richmond Hill. The downtown location has a rustic and modern interior. Sitting is somewhat limited. I opted for the Royal No. 9 milk tea ($5 + 0.5 toppings). The Alley did not disappoint. The tea finishes with a hint of blueberry. Sugar cane syrup is made in house. Tapioca or Deerioca (as they coined it) are made from scratch; kneading and rolling fresh dough into small tapioca balls. With that being said, the tapioca to drink ratio felt slightly off. I wish there was a little more tapioca. Overall, The Alley cost slightly more than other bubble tea stores and charges additional $0.5 for hot drinks. It is well worth the extra $2.\",\n",

A huge reason is because their drinks don\\'t taste as powder-artificial as other bubble tea chains, and they\\'re good at brewing a strong tea. The Royal 9 milk tea has been an Asian hit for years and at this shop it\\'s a blend of black tea and blueberry tea leaves, but I\\'ve recalled having a rose variety. The brown sugar ginger milk tea is very gingery and refreshing, not too sweet despite not being able to adjust the sweetness. You\\'ll feel the zing and heat of the ginger. The purple rice cocoa is a welcomed spin on a hot chocolate that has the soothing quality and rice-y sweetness of purple rice (a popular feature in Thai and Chinese desserts) The \"classic milk tea\" however is rather bland and despite delivering a buzz, left my tea craving unsatisfied. The hojicha soy milk (roasted rice tea, infused in soy milk!) is lightly sweetened, and a great combo. As they\\'re newly opened the service can seem kind of slow and they call out drinks by the receipt number. So don\\'t come here in a rush.',\n",

Now that it's more accessible at a commuter friendly location, I can't wait to try the various flavours. A popular recommendation is the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea and did not disappoint. The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend. I would want to try their Aurora Series next as you get to keep a cute bottle and it has a pretty blend of colours. I'm also keen on trying the Garden Milk Tea since the presentation is cool.

Their top drink is their Royal No.9 milk tea which is a blueberry milk tea. Veeeery good - I totally see why it's their top seller. They usually give out free samples of this drink near the cash register because it's so popular (I always take a sample even though I know how it tastes already, haha). I also tried their northern lights drink, the passion fruit green tea, and their oreo devil slush. All very good. The passion fruit green tea isn't as great as other tea shops I've been to but it's decent! And the northern lights drink isn't too bad.. tastes like freshly juiced grapes and looks like a cool little galaxy in a bottle - you get a nice little bottle too! The place is quite aesthetic looking with nice decor but has limited seats. There's still long lines occasionally since it just opened - come at non-peak hours or near closing to avoid the lines.

I absolutely loved the interior decor, much more modern and sophisticated than your average store. There's enough seating for 12-15 people, the main area is quite spacious so you can wait for your order without suffering a bout of claustrophobia, the preparation/kitchen area is kept immaculate, staffs are polite and helpful, superior selections of tea that you'll mainly see at brewed-to-order cafes. Prices are reasonable, though everything in Toronto seems to rival prices of more expensive parts of nyc. We ordered an iced hojicha latte (with bubbles) and their alley trio bubble tea. Hojicha - I love hojicha, my favourite tea of all teas so I had high expectations after being disappointed with boba guys. I can't say these guys delivered on that front either, the hojicha flavour came through but was SUPER concentrated, even the colour (after being mixed in with the milk thoroughly) was 10 shades too dark. I recommend getting it less sweet as it was overwhelmingly sweet, add the sugar from the bubbles and it was hard for me to finish. **sigggghhhh** just disappointing :( Trio bubble milk tea - it was just classic milk tea, 'trio' referring to the 3 types of toppings which were pearls/jelly and something else I can't remember. We ordered it to be less sweet, thank god we did because the sugar from the toppings gave it the perfect amount of sweetness. I was very pleased with this one, and would recommend others give it a go. If anything, stop by to enjoy a decent bubble tea and nice cafe with good atmosphere.\",\n",

Of course, I hyped myself up with high expectations and was not looking to be disappointed. The Alley was quite away from my hotel but in the end, it was worth the walk! I was not disappointed. This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip.

I'm usually not one to get milk teas (I prefer fruity), so I'm pretty surprised at how I've been sucked into their milk teas! So far, I've tried Deerioca Fever, Trio Milk Tea, and Royal No.9. I've to say, Royal No.9 is my favourite of the three - it is light with a hint of blueberry after taste, very different from other milk teas. The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about. Would definitely recommend trying this spot! TIP: download their app. Every drink gets you a point. You can get a free drink after 10 points!\",\n",

And other decorations along the walls. Ordered the Trio Milk Tea which comes with tapioca, rainbow jelly, and something else, which is not bad cause toppings are 50 cents each and you\\'re basically spending an extra 50 cents to get classic milk tea with three toppings. I\\'m ok with the basic stuff so it works out for me. Other places also offer their own \"triple topping\" combos but I think the rainbow jelly was a good choice cause it provided some fruity flavors. BBT prices have been steadily going up and the prices here are probably just a bit higher than most places (and not much either you\\'re looking at maybe a quarter or two?)

I've had bubble tea from the west coast of the US, east coast of the US, and now it was time to try Canadian bubble tea. I was pleasantly surprised! After walking for hours at the Royal Ontario Museum; I hopped into a uber and stopped by The Alley. My first impression was that this cafe was super cute and had so many drink options! I was going to get the cute Aurora Series drinks at first, but they take 30 minutes to make so I passed on that. I ended up getting the Alley Trio (consists of milk tea w/ 3 toppings) and their bestseller the Royal No.9 (milk tea with blue berry!) I loved the flavors of both drinks and was highly considering getting another one (but I had to eat dinner so I didn't). If you opt to get a hot drink, you get a cute cup with a deer shaped cup holder. I would be lying if I said I didn't order the hot drink just for the cup holder (haha). The people working at The Alley were accommodating and took the time to answer any questions I had. Oh I wish they would open one in NYC!\",\n",

When I heard that The Alley opened up in downtown toronto, and near my work place, I was like \"OH NO, there\\'s already a Coco, HappyLemon, and Sharetea all around the same block.\" But, the good thing is, they\\'re all unique and offer different tastes of teas. Honestly, when I visited The Alley in markham a couple months ago, I did not enjoy it (maybe because of the drink I ordered: Trio milk tea). This time, I ordered the, all famous, ROYAL NO. 9! I could really taste the hint of blueberry! Will definitely come again for the drink! As per those who are thinking of getting their trio milk tea, if you like coconut/fruit jelly in your milk tea, by all means ~ but if you\\'re someone who doesn\\'t mix well with a combination of fruits, milk and tea - I might tell you to avoid it and try something else - it is definitely a more adventurous pick!!

       "  'reviewMessage': \"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour!

       "  'reviewMessage': 'On a scale of one to ten; how in love with bubble tea are you? The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It\\'s a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I\\'m pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That\\'s how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they\\'re always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you\\'re in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there\\'s all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley\\'s Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they\\'re famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley\\'s signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow\\'s milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you\\'ll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn\\'t get more solid. I\\'d been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn\\'t described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don\\'t just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn\\'t quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I\\'m not sure what I expected, but what I r',\n",

Like most yelpers said has a blueberry undertone that you would not get at other bubble tea shops. Atmosphere/service: The washroom is wheelchair accessible, major bonus. The decor is rustic reinforcing their brand. There is some seating but a nice social space to have a chat with friends. Price: $5-7, in line with most premium bubble tea shops.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'Amazing bubble tea place! I went there after lunch on a weekday afternoon hoping to get some work done and grab some good drinks too at the same time, and needless to say, I was not disappointed. This place is located near UofT downtown campus, which can maybe make the place crowded. Fortunately, at the time where I went, which was on a weekday during vacations, I was able to easily find a table to settle myself. As for the drinks, there are various interesting choices from which you can choose. I went for the Brown Sugar Deerioca. It was suggested for me and it was also a plus since there was no actual tea (I sometimes have trouble sleeping at night if I drink coffee or tea on afternoons lol). The drink itself was fantastic! The drink consisted of, from what I can gather, of the bubbles, brown sugar and milk. The mix might sound uninteresting but I can assure you, it was easily one of the best drinks I ever had. The flavors were very well blend together. I would definitely come back to this spot!',\n",

I got literally way too excited when knowing Toronto has several The Alley locations since my boba tea addiction is no joke. The first thing I would try here is Brown sugar deerioca fever with fresh milk. It was just best of the best! You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended! It also came in a very cute bottle. The only thing I did not like nor anticipate is parking. It's located underneath the condos and parallel parking there was a hassle.\",\n",

I\\'m happy it\\'s close to my work out studio and use it as an excuse to treat myself to one of their milk teas! I\\'ve had the Royal No. 9 which has a blueberry hint, kind of reminded me of a rose tea that didn\\'t taste like your grandma\\'s perfume. Iron Goddess is a flavourful milk tea which I\\'ll usually pair up with tapioca and coffee jelly and the oh so sweet..brown sugar deerioca with soy milk. The tapioca is very sweet and warm but with the freshness from the soy milk, it balances out really well. As pretty as it is, with the syrup drizzle on the side of the cup..I always shake it up really well because all the gooey syrup is at the bottom, it\\'s like sucking up diabetes right there haha. I\\'m just upset it only comes in the smaller size! I took my friend there and she got some sort of lime tea..refreshing but her mistake was agreeing to the lime \"zest\" which were actually lime bits that made it hard for her to drink. She sure had fun picking those bits out of her mouth hehe.',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I had a really good experience at The Alley. My friend and I came here for a drink and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end. The ambiance in the restaurant is warm and cozy. The restaurant has a nice feeling and all of the employees are really friendly, helpful and kind. Before I placed my order, I told the employee I was both gluten and lactose intolerant. The two employees working at the counter recommended I try the Brown Sugar Deerioca or the ginger sweet tea since I had a sore throat. I decided to order the Brown Sugar Deerioca beverage to enjoy at the restaurant and I ended up getting the Sweet Ginger Tea to-go. When I received the Brown Sugar Deerioca, it was presented in three beautiful layers. The dark coloured tapioca was prominent at the bottom of the cup and a rich caramel colour was above it with a creamy white colour on top. I mixed the three layers together and will try my best to describe the amazing flavour of this drink. The tapioca was fresh, warm and chewy; I could tell it had just been cooked. The flavour of the brown sugar layer and the almond milk layer were fantastic! It tasted like a sugar syrup you would bake on the stove yet it also kind of reminded me of cotton candy. It made my mind think of a delicious caramel sauce. The flavour pallet of this bubble tea was beyond any type I have tried in the past. It was definitely an experience and I highly recommend you check it out too. Ginger Sweet Tea To-Go! The sweet ginger tea tasted really good and definitely helped soothe my sore throat. If you're feeling a bit under the weather this would definitely help you. Now for the ICING on the CAKE! My to-go drink had a special touch most restaurants do not have. My to-go cup was served with a deer sleeve that had a strap that allows guests to carry their beverage out of the store without burning their hands. The drink sleeve had a handle. It was the most adorable drink sleeve I have ever used and I hope more restaurants start implementing sleeves like this. It is very creative and innovative. To see what it looks like, find my photo. In Summary: ... I would definitely return to this bubble tea restaurant when in the area. Tip: Make sure you get their loyalty card.\",\n",

Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'On a scale of one to ten; how in love with bubble tea are you? The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It\\'s a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I\\'m pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That\\'s how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they\\'re always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you\\'re in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there\\'s all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley\\'s Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they\\'re famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley\\'s signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow\\'s milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you\\'ll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn\\'t get more solid. I\\'d been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn\\'t described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don\\'t just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn\\'t quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I\\'m not sure what I expected, but what I r',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Ambience 4.5/5: Laid-back, moose-decorated hipsterish cafe. Very relaxed, with outlets along the window. More space than the usual boba place. Appearance 5/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

I've to say, Royal No.9 is my favourite of the three - it is light with a hint of blueberry after taste, very different from other milk teas. The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about.

We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"The Alley is one of my favourite bubble tea shop! I absolutely LOVE the Deerioca, which is warm brown sugar boba in cold soy milk. It's so good because you can drink it two ways - mix it up so the whole drink is infused with brown sugar flavour OR don't mix it and have a mixture of warm boba and cold soy milk. I also LOVE the Jasmine Green Milk Tea with boba. Jasmine is one of my favourite flavours in the planet, and the boba at the Alley is so perfectly chewy! The Royal No 9 is a classic the Alley drink, but it's not my favourite.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I think this is quite probably one of the nicest Alley locations in the GTA. The line up was not very long despite being on a busy street in downtown Toronto. Nonetheless the place was packed. The first thing that I liked about this place was that there was actually room to sit down (well if you got a spot). The decor was also really nice and aesthetic. The service was quite fast and the staff were really friendly. One thing they need to improve though is the queue for the line. It's kind of all over the place. This time I decided on a jasmine green milk tea (with no sugar). It was really refreshing and so tasty! You really can taste the quality of tea that they brew unlike other places which just use powders. Deerioca is also an amazing drink here, and Royal No. 9. In all, this Alley is a solid spot!\",\n",

Anyways, everything about it was just better than all the other bubble tea I\\'ve had before... the quality, the taste, the tapioca.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"The Alley is becoming one of my favourite bubble tea places, having been here a number of times and tried many of their drinks. Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

Now that it's more accessible at a commuter friendly location, I can't wait to try the various flavours. A popular recommendation is the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea and did not disappoint. The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend. I would want to try their Aurora Series next as you get to keep a cute bottle and it has a pretty blend of colours. I'm also keen on trying the Garden Milk Tea since the presentation is cool.

Appearance 5/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!!

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I've been wanting to try this Taiwanese chain since I heard they opened up locations in Toronto. Especially when I heard that New York was JUST opening up their first location. Take that NYC, we beat you to the punch (bubble tea). We ordered the original Deerioca and the Deerioca matcha. I think I still prefer the original brown sugar milk drink but the matcha one was pretty good too! The only thing I didn't like about the drinks was that once in a while there would be a super hard tapioca, completely unexpected. I felt like I was gonna loose a tooth. I've been debating whether I should give this place three or four stars, because other than the super hard random tapioca balls, everything else was great. I decided on three stars so I can get the business owner's attention on this issue. I will definitely be coming back to The Alley to try some of the other stuff, hopefully by then I won't be getting random super hard tapioca balls in my drinks.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Ambience 4.5/5: Laid-back, moose-decorated hipsterish cafe. Very relaxed, with outlets along the window. More space than the usual boba place. Appearance 5/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"One of the better spots I've tried! Their drink list is extensive categorized from milk tea to fresh milk to fruit teas. The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great! I definitely recommend trying this spot.\",\n",

While the Alley is pricier than most areas, I firmly believe the increase in price is well worth it. The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever. Honestly, there's no item on the menu I wouldn't recommend trying out at least once. Although it is very far from where I live, the ride on the subway is one I'd be willing to take just for this great place.\",\n",

Their top drink is their Royal No.9 milk tea which is a blueberry milk tea. Veeeery good - I totally see why it's their top seller. They usually give out free samples of this drink near the cash register because it's so popular (I always take a sample even though I know how it tastes already, haha). I also tried their northern lights drink, the passion fruit green tea, and their oreo devil slush. All very good. The passion fruit green tea isn't as great as other tea shops I've been to but it's decent! And the northern lights drink isn't too bad.. tastes like freshly juiced grapes and looks like a cool little galaxy in a bottle - you get a nice little bottle too! The place is quite aesthetic looking with nice decor but has limited seats. There's still long lines occasionally since it just opened - come at non-peak hours or near closing to avoid the lines.

Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour!

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I researched where to get a good boba during my trip to Toronto. Consistently, The Alley was mentioned as the best place. Of course, I hyped myself up with high expectations and was not looking to be disappointed. The Alley was quite away from my hotel but in the end, it was worth the walk! I was not disappointed. This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip. I didn't end up doing it but the next time I go to Toronto, I will make it a point to go again!\",\n",

The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great! I definitely recommend trying this spot.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

I've had bubble tea from the west coast of the US, east coast of the US, and now it was time to try Canadian bubble tea. I was pleasantly surprised! After walking for hours at the Royal Ontario Museum; I hopped into a uber and stopped by The Alley. My first impression was that this cafe was super cute and had so many drink options! I was going to get the cute Aurora Series drinks at first, but they take 30 minutes to make so I passed on that. I ended up getting the Alley Trio (consists of milk tea w/ 3 toppings) and their bestseller the Royal No.9 (milk tea with blue berry!) I loved the flavors of both drinks and was highly considering getting another one (but I had to eat dinner so I didn't). If you opt to get a hot drink, you get a cute cup with a deer shaped cup holder. I would be lying if I said I didn't order the hot drink just for the cup holder (haha). The people working at The Alley were accommodating and took the time to answer any questions I had. Oh I wish they would open one in NYC!\",\n",

I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic! The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour!

It was probably one of the best matcha lattes I've ever had. I personally do not like matcha when it is overly bitter and this wasn't bitter at all, just sweet/creamy. I asked for 75% sugar and it was still a bit sweet for me. I can't imagine what 100% is like! Indoor seating is currently available with proof of vaccination. The seating area is basically the back which also has tea menus for tasting. I love the aesthetic of the back seating area. It feels like a tranquil place to sip tea.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Spadina Avenue has many bubble tea shops, but there is also this cute independent cafe/tea bar that serves Chinese tea, matcha, and tea-infused treats. Icha Tea (一茶間) is known as the heaven for tea lovers on Spadina Avenue. Once you step in, you can first order at the counter. There are a few seats where you can sit and wait for your takeout orders. Otherwise, you can continue to walk inside, passing through an authentic Chinese tea bar, and you can then find more seatings. It is spacious and quiet. There are many students working in the corner, as well as groups chilling around with drinks and desserts. You can order tea-infused bubble tea at the storefront, and I decided to order a simple, classic Matcha Latte. The shop uses Isuzu Matcha (五十鈴) in their drinks, and they are prepared fresh to order. Though the drink does look delicious, it tastes bland. Matcha flavor is overpowered by the milk itself, which means more matcha powder is needed to make a richer drink. It is quite disappointing to try this in a tea bar. Anyway, we also ordered two desserts, which are Sesame Tofu Cheesecake and Matcha Roll. We were asked to wait for 15 minutes because the roll cake is in the processing of defrosting. Since we had some spare time, so we decided to first try the Sesame Tofu Cheesecake. It is a square-shaped cheesecake with crackers crumb as a base. The cheesecake itself has a strong, pungent sesame flavor, yet tofu flavor is lacking. I was expecting the texture to be silky soft like tofu or at least creamy. It is still creamy, but it is on a harder side. After 20 minutes of wait, the Matcha Roll arrived, and it is totally worth the wait. The matcha cream is creamy and strong. The matcha flavor is left in my mouth after each bite. The cake is soft and spongy. The proportion of cake and cream is perfect, so I don't feel heavy after finishing it. For $5.50, I would totally order this again. *** Overall Impression *** There are definitely hit and miss items at Icha Tea. However, the service is great, and I like how the tea bar is quiet and spacious, with many seatings. Though it has 4.6/5 on Google review, I think it is slightly overrated, as they cannot perfect a cup of matcha latte. I could be ordering the wrong drinks because after all, it is a Chinese tea bar. One item I highly recommend is the Matcha Roll. I would come back again for other desserts on the menu, as well as trying some real tea next time!

I couldn't decide between Matcha Latte Milk Tea and the Matcha Crafted Tea, but the cashier was very helpful and told me to go for the former. Luckily, I was able to get the very last batch of tapioca that day, but my friend couldn't get any for his Classic Milk Tea. Upon receiving the drink, I was able to snap some aesthetic photos as the interior here was very gorgeous and visually appealing. I also did not know the Matcha Latte Milk Tea needed to be mixed up before drinking, but the barista afterward kindly told me the drink tastes much better when mixed. The Matcha drink tasted a little bitter as expected since it is essentially green tea, but a bit sweet as well since it is milk tea. The tapioca tasted very standard and wasn't very bland nor sweet. There is a bigger seating area when you walk deeper into the store, in which the lighting is very dim which gives off a very relaxing vibe. Also, no outside foods are allowed! If you are into photographing food pictures or nice pictures in general, Icha Tea is the place for you! Not only is the interior aesthetics, but the drinks here are pretty tasty.

It's creamy but definitely can still taste the matcha and it isn't loaded with syrup nor is it bitter. The only problem is Icha is it's SO FAR. The first time I went, I asked what's good and was told the Osmanthus Oolong Milk Tea was his favourite, so I got that and the blessed Matcha Latte. I didn't like the Osmanthus beverage. It had a very light floral taste but mostly just tasted like milk. I appreciate how he actually recommended a specific item vs oh, everything's good though! Also, the guy actually cares about his work. He was showing what I'm assuming was a new employee how to make the drink and he was being so patient and showing her how it should be done and what not to do. It's not like he was super slow with it and made me wait forever for the drink either. TL;DR: matcha latte is bomb, employees give real recommendations, employees care about their work\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Icha Tea is truly a hidden gem in Toronto's Chinatown. If you walk by too quickly you might just miss its tiny storefront. At first glance it appears that Icha Tea is a quick-serve bubble tea shop but if you walk inside, it offers so much more. The front of the shop has a counter for grab and go drinks but the narrow shop actually keeps going and there is lot of seating in the back with a relaxing ambiance. The decor is very cute with displays of ceramic tea wares including some that are available for purchase. There is a bar space where guests can enjoy a traditional Gong Fu tea pouring experience and learn more about Chinese tea customs. If you would rather pour your own tea, you can also get a tea set on a tray with a little teapot and small cups for sharing. Icha Tea's main focus is high quality loose leaf teas from China and Taiwan which still applies to their milk teas and bubble teas as well. You definitely won't find any powdered drink mixes here. I have tried both their tea bar and their milk teas and you can really taste the difference. The tea itself is more fragrant and there are many kinds to choose from. One of my favourite loose leaf teas is the Milk Oolong which is actually enjoyed black but it naturally has a creamy caramel scent. From their quick service teas, I really loved the iced matcha latte with tapioca pearls. The Japanese matcha is whisked to order and you can choose your sweetness level. In general, the sweetness level here is much lower than other tea spots, so you might have to order it on the sweeter side if that is what you are used to. I have also tried some of their house made desserts and they are quite unique and delicious. I really like the Black Sesame Tofu Cheesecake which is light and nutty. I also love their Jasmine Rose Pudding which is very floral and has the texture of a mousse mixed with a panna cotta. Service is always so warm and friendly here too. The people working here are always happy to answer my questions and show me different teas. Whenever I bring my friends to Icha Tea, they always love it too.\",\n",

I tried both their hot and cold matcha lattes half sweet and I can tell by the texture they carefully whisked the matcha to perfection. For myself, half sweet was perfect for tasting the richness of the matcha. I also added tapioca to the drinks. I have to say the tapioca was under whelming as chewing it the balls weren't soft all the way through. I can't forget to mention the atmosphere at this tea shop is wonderful. Great customer service, followed by a gorgeously designed interior, and not to mention alot of seating. The cozey atmosphere with slightly dimmed lights make this the perfect spot for grabbing a drink with a friend, studying, or enjoying a conversation over a drink. All in all was a wonderful experience and will most definitely come again!\",\n",

All the tea is freshly brewed right in front of you using their tea steepers. I wanted to love what I go but I didn't. I got the Rose Jasmine Milk Tea with pearls, something that was recommended by a friend. The barista steeped the tea right in front of my eyes and I could see the beautiful tea leaves floating in the steeper. My only issue when it comes to freshly steeped tea is inconsistency. This is coming from someone who worked at a tea shop for a year - who makes your tea matters SO much. When I got my drink, it was disappointing to say the least. I couldnt take the rose notes at all. It tasted like a regular green milk tea I could have gotten anywhere else. I'm a little disappointed because it was pricier being freshly brewed tea, but I could taste the notes of it! I wasn't able to get any floral notes at all. My theory would be temperature of water, or timing wasn't quite right for my drink because it was rather disappointing for me. The pearls were average, not bad, but nothing to scream about. I LOVE the decor. I am definitely keen on coming back again to try the Rose Jasmine Tea with cheese foam, as I'm hoping if the milk isn't directly infused into the drink, it might make it the floral notes more noticible.\",\n",

The drinks are made with freshly brewed tea, which obviously takes longer to make but is so worth it. The drinks are also a little more expensive than your typical bubble tea, but again, it's worth it. I got the rose jasmine bubble tea, and it was absolutely delicious. I think the sugar is already toned down here compared to your average bubble tea, so even if you normally reduce down to 50% sugar in your standard bubble tea/latte/frappuccino, I wouldn't recommend doing that here. The interior is really nice. At first glance, it looks like a super tiny shop, but once you walked inside, there's a nice sitting area in the back. I wish I had taken pictures to show just how nice this place looks. There's an intimate vibe that makes this place seem like it'd be really good for studying and just having a quiet chat with a friend.

I'm sure they use premium tea leaves but it doesn't excuse the fact that both of our milk teas were garbage. The drinks were essentially 20% tea and 80% milk. You can't even taste the tea. The drinks tasted like milk. If I wanted to drink milk, I would just buy it at the supermarket for $4 not $7. Also, the tapoica was so hard to chew on. What a waste of money.

Location was easy to find, set up of the store was nicely done as well. This is a great spot to hang out for catch-ups as it's not too noisy. Menu isn't too large and for someone who has difficulty making decisions on what to order all the time (that's me if you couldn't guess), this was a nice change.

Younger me we would have definitely gotten it with full sugar but now that I'm old, I can't handle it, so 50% sweetness is perfect. It's creamy but definitely can still taste the matcha and it isn't loaded with syrup nor is it bitter. The only problem is Icha is it's SO FAR. The first time I went, I asked what's good and was told the Osmanthus Oolong Milk Tea was his favourite, so I got that and the blessed Matcha Latte. I didn't like the Osmanthus beverage. It had a very light floral taste but mostly just tasted like milk. I appreciate how he actually recommended a specific item vs oh, everything's good though! Also, the guy actually cares about his work. He was showing what I'm assuming was a new employee how to make the drink and he was being so patient and showing her how it should be done and what not to do. It's not like he was super slow with it and made me wait forever for the drink either. TL;DR: matcha latte is bomb, employees give real recommendations, employees care about their work\",\n",

Compared to every other bubble tea place, Icha Tea is one of the more expensive bubble tea place (around $7 after tax). With this type of price, I expect quality to come through. I'm sure they use premium tea leaves but it doesn't excuse the fact that both of our milk teas were garbage. The drinks were essentially 20% tea and 80% milk. You can't even taste the tea. The drinks tasted like milk. If I wanted to drink milk, I would just buy it at the supermarket for $4 not $7. Also, the tapoica was so hard to chew on. What a waste of money. Not sure how one can screw up milk teas this bad. Avoid this place if you wanna drink any type of milk bubble tea.\",\n",

The interior of the shop is very modern and bright and deep. The shop is long as when you walk in there the front ordering area but there are a few steps down which leads you into the back where it's the sitting area for the customers. The interior design I give it 5 stars! The drinks are priced at a decent average price at which most bubble charge at which is is around $4-$4.50 (cold drinks) and hot are a dollar cheaper. I had ordered the oolong milk tea with pearls and got another one which was the rose jasmine cheese foam tea. They brew the tea fresh in the stores with quality ingredients and tea leaves, so the quality is there. First initial sips of both drinks I found it very watered down and did not taste alot of the tea flavor in both. The milk tea did not have a strong tea flavor which I was hoping for and with the cheese foam it just tasted like a very fresh flower (whatever that means if you eat flowers? ) The pearls were a bit overcooked and a little soft and mushy but not a big deal. Just overall, I had higher expectations for the taste of the drinks but didn't get what I thought. Perhaps the sugar level I got was not enough and maybe that's the factor on why I thought the drinks didn't taste as good. Good location for this type of business but a bit disappointed.\",\n",

Luckily, I was able to get the very last batch of tapioca that day, but my friend couldn't get any for his Classic Milk Tea. Upon receiving the drink, I was able to snap some aesthetic photos as the interior here was very gorgeous and visually appealing. I also did not know the Matcha Latte Milk Tea needed to be mixed up before drinking, but the barista afterward kindly told me the drink tastes much better when mixed. The Matcha drink tasted a little bitter as expected since it is essentially green tea, but a bit sweet as well since it is milk tea. The tapioca tasted very standard and wasn't very bland nor sweet. There is a bigger seating area when you walk deeper into the store, in which the lighting is very dim which gives off a very relaxing vibe. Also, no outside foods are allowed! If you are into photographing food pictures or nice pictures in general, Icha Tea is the place for you! Not only is the interior aesthetics, but the drinks here are pretty tasty.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"If you had to go to one bubble tea place while in Toronto, definitely visit Icha Tea. They're a brewed-to-order tea house with a super cute cafe setup at the front of the store (seating for about 10 people), to the rear it there appeared to be a larger room with classical-style tables and chairs (which I assume is for formal tea services). They have a small but beautiful selection of desserts to have with your tea, mostly uncommon flavours like black sesame and lapsang (flavoured from a type of black tea). The desserts aren't overtly sweet but rather subtly compliments your tea. I ordered the lapsang cheesecake with a large classic milk tea (25% sugar, bubbles). The tea was very fragrant, not being overpowered by the milk, the bubbles were a lovely chewy texture with a touch of firmness in the centre. The only thing I might of changed was perhaps increasing the sweetness level to really bring out the maximum flavours of the tea. The cheesecake was to die for, I think the base of the actual filling must have been tofu which gave it a much lighter density, the flavours of the tea cut through the filling, the base was a soft moist crumble and I loved the gelatine film that decorated the top. The flavours married together very well, it was the first cheesecake I've had that was subtly sweet and it's been one of the best dessert experiences to date. The cafe isn't a place for group gatherings, perhaps a hangout spot with a friend, definitely a date stop off. Not child friendly, or wheelchair/stroller accessible. Will definitely be back during a return trip to Toronto, highly recommended! :)\",\n",

Besides their tea, there is also a small dessert menu and opportunities to purchase some of their teas to make at home as well.

It's one of the rare bubble tea joints that gets most things right: warm lighting, ambient but not overwhelming music, big tables, plenty of space. Unlike the overwhelming, purple lighting of Chatime and other youthful joints that are hard on older eyes, Icha Tea will use analog lights and natural tones. You're here for the experience and the price reflects it. The specialty teas are largely made from loose leaves. I usually get the osmanthus Oolong tea, with or without milk, full sweetness--they understand Asian taste buds. -1 star because--during the time I went--there were always small things that came up in service, like late or altogether forgotten orders. It should be smoother now!\",\n",

We tried the cold osmanthus oolong tea with cheese foam tea. The taste was incredible. The atmosphere was also beautiful and calming, with a variety of tea making items on display and for sale. They also offer a variety of tea tasting options, which I will try next time. Staff were very helpful and knowledgeabld. They did not have tapioca balls ready, and kindly offered to substitute in the cheese foam instead. I will definitely return. Congratulations to the owners and servers for making the tastiest tea drink I've ever had.\",\n",

Recommendations are key, as some teas can be stronger than others - so don't be scared to ask! We got one classic milk tea and one osmanthus oolong tea. The wait wasn't bad as there were other customers ahead of us, but what I loved was the connection they made with each other customer. The tea itself is great, especially in the milk tea. It has a richer flavour to it than the powdered milk teas. As for the tapioca, it needs to be a bit more sweeter to make it perfect. I would hit this spot in the summer if you're looking for something different in your bubble tea adventure.\",\n",

There is a tea bar where you can sit and observe your tea being made in a traditional method (pouring and repouring to get the temperature right). Yet there's a sense of casualness in this old method. Around the bar where I sat, quaint teapots and little cups scattered around in the most charming messy way. You will surely be entertained by looking at the various shapes and art from those tea sets. I ordered the jasmine green tea from the menu, and the girl behind the bar proceeded to make my tea, starting with steeping the tea leaves. She poured the tea from one container to another repeatedly, feeling the temperature of the container with her hands until she was satisfied, then she poured the tea into the pot and presented it to me. With some of the other teas, she also took a whiff to smell the tea to see if they were ready. My tea was amazing. The fragrance was so lovely and the taste was calming. No trace of bitter taste. Unlike wine tasting where you get the tasting for free if you buy the bottle, this tea shop doesn't operate this way lol. You pay for the tea tasting, and the tea leaves by grams if you wish to bring some home. This experience and products don't come cheap.

Compared to every other bubble tea place, Icha Tea is one of the more expensive bubble tea place (around $7 after tax). With this type of price, I expect quality to come through. I'm sure they use premium tea leaves but it doesn't excuse the fact that both of our milk teas were garbage. The drinks were essentially 20% tea and 80% milk. You can't even taste the tea. The drinks tasted like milk. If I wanted to drink milk, I would just buy it at the supermarket for $4 not $7. Also, the tapoica was so hard to chew on. What a waste of money. Not sure how one can screw up milk teas this bad. Avoid this place if you wanna drink any type of milk bubble tea.\",\n",

The handcrafted teas are made before your eyes and unlike other bubble tea shops the tea doesn't come out of a huge jug (not that I'm hating on huge jugs of tea). I can't say I can really taste the difference in the quality (maybe I lack a refined palate for tea). I've tried the matcha tea and the black milk tea and I have to say the matcha does have a nice flavour but I don't really care to pay a premium on slightly better quality tea when I can easily walk down the street for a cheaper cup of tea. The best part about Icha is probably the backroom which has plenty of seating where you can find tons of students studying. If you like tea and can actually discern the quality of your drink, then this is the place for you. If you just want a cup of bubble tea without paying and arm and a leg for it, then I'd pass on this place.\",\n",

I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is. It can get really crowded even if you are just getting takeout. There isn't much space for you to stand while waiting for your drink.\",\n",

They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it\\'s worth getting the free card if you think you\\'ll be back in the future. There\\'s also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I\\'ve been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.',\n",

Line ups at this location is always long reaching to the end of the restaurant, it's around a 10-15 minute wait. I always get it with roasted jelly which is BOMB. I get 30% sugar but recently I've been going with 0% which I honestly think is just fine. Theres still a hint of sweetness from the grass jelly and the flavour is still there. Other drinks I really enjoy is the Oolong milk tea and the taro milk tea, both super good, taro especially. You can tasted the real flavour of the taro and the texture.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'I was not a fan of Chatime last year and went off around downtown looking for a go-to bubbletea shop and alas, gave Chatime another try and must withdraw my previous review. I have been back several times in the last few weeks and my drink has been consistent every time :) Best pearls in the city, always perfectly sweetened and cooked. I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn\\'t watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn\\'t overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn\\'t see there\\'s an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me. The wait can be long and stuffy but the staff are efficient. Also, get a Vicinity points card and you can get a free birthday regular drink.',\n",

The shop is constantly filled with weaving lines that make it difficult to find seating. Good problems? The popularity of this franchise is undeniable, so I thought I\\'d try to help out first time customers with some recommendations: 1) My favourite drinks are the roasted milk tea with grass jelly and the pearl milk tea. 2) Don\\'t be afraid to venture away from traditional tapioca and into other types of jellies that they offer (although their tapioca preparation is fantastic). 3) You can adjust the amount of ice and sugar in your drink. I always ask for \"less ice\". Who needs a drink that cold? 4) Take a good look at their entire menu - they offer 80+ flavours. You\\'ll have a great chance to check it out while waiting in line.

I love how you can customize the sugar and ice levels. I usually opt out on both since I find the drinks already sufficiently sweet enough and you get a few more sips without the ice. Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste. If you want a cheaper bubble tea you'll be compromising on quality and taste and will probably end up with a sugar laden drink made with some powder or liquid mixture of synthetic flavours.

My friend suggested that I try the Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly. She even specifically told me to order it with less ice and 80% sugar. The taste is pretty interesting and I like it. For whatever reason, it reminds me of VitaSoy's malted soybean milk. Mmm...and I love grass jelly! I took another friend of mine to try their Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly last night. Despite being a rainy Wednesday evening, we still had to wait 20 minutes in line. This little teashop was incredibly crowded. But once I placed our order, it was not long before we received our drinks. The cashier also gave me a reward card last night. You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...) I'm sure I will return because I like the fact that they give you the option to choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, and the Roasted Milk Tea is pretty good.\",\n",

The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea\",\n",

First time that I've ever had grass jelly and really like how they give you the choice of how much sugar you want and even ice! Fully customizable, every BBT should be like this and way too many options (a good problem to have). Anyways, we tried: - Chatime roasted milk tea with grass jelly ($4.70 for a large). Delicious. I ordered it with less ice and 50% sugar, which was perfect. If Iived in Tdot, would definitely come here all the time. - Hazelnut chocolate milk tea with pudding ($4.20 for regular + $0.50 for pudding). Definitely on the sweeter side but the pudding was interesting option to add to my friend's drink. - QQ honeydew milk tea ($4.50 for regular) Great spot.

I tried the fruit ones before but it tasted very generic artificial like other bubble tea shops. Chatime is awesome for letting you choose the ice and sugar level.

I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'Wait wut? There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don\\'t see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what\\'s so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what\\'s with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn\\'t enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don\\'t even know what you get if you didn\\'t--like what\\'s the default ice and sugar? Let\\'s not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca/\\'boba\\'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they\\'re not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there\\'s a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don\\'t get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn\\'t blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it\\'s the 505 or the Bay bus.}',\n",

They have opened up many locations, but my two favourites are at Finch and Richmond Hill. Here we ordered the mango green tea, less sugar, half ice. It was good but not as good as the other two locations. I do give it a thumps up for efficiency, speed, and cost!You should try there top 10 best sellers. You are bound to like one or more of them. My all time favourite is the grass jelly roasted milk tea, less ice, half sugar. Though sometimes I opt for less ice, and less sugar. It depends how I feel. Either way, it is tasty!

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I. AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)\",\n",

Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends. Summary: ChaTime reminds me of those bbtea joints back in Vancouver. I will def be back later to try my next fav bbtea flavor, iced honey green tea!!\",\n",

The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins.

I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is. It can get really crowded even if you are just getting takeout. There isn't much space for you to stand while waiting for your drink.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'The line up, which can sometimes go all the way to the back of the store and wrap back towards the entrance, can get a bit unruly during rush hour, but for bubble tea addicts like me, Chatime is a staple. They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it\\'s worth getting the free card if you think you\\'ll be back in the future. There\\'s also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I\\'ve been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.',\n",

Right when you enter one you can smell the teas being roasted I LOVE IT! It's the best milk tea I've tasted around although some might argue with me. Line ups at this location is always long reaching to the end of the restaurant, it's around a 10-15 minute wait. I always get it with roasted jelly which is BOMB. I get 30% sugar but recently I've been going with 0% which I honestly think is just fine. Theres still a hint of sweetness from the grass jelly and the flavour is still there. Other drinks I really enjoy is the Oolong milk tea and the taro milk tea, both super good, taro especially. You can tasted the real flavour of the taro and the texture. Although I feel the texture of the taro has been watered down quite a bit since a few years ago.\",\n",

They didn't have enough space inside to accommodate the line and people sitting, as the people in line were literally 5cm from the people sitting. I do give them credit though for moving the line relatively quick. The Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea was really good, and they followed directions with ice and sweetness perfectly.

I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn\\'t watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn\\'t overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn\\'t see there\\'s an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me.

The shop is constantly filled with weaving lines that make it difficult to find seating. Good problems? The popularity of this franchise is undeniable, so I thought I\\'d try to help out first time customers with some recommendations: 1) My favourite drinks are the roasted milk tea with grass jelly and the pearl milk tea. 2) Don\\'t be afraid to venture away from traditional tapioca and into other types of jellies that they offer (although their tapioca preparation is fantastic). 3) You can adjust the amount of ice and sugar in your drink. I always ask for \"less ice\". Who needs a drink that cold? 4) Take a good look at their entire menu - they offer 80+ flavours. You\\'ll have a great chance to check it out while waiting in line. Hope your experience at Chatime is as great as its millions of customers\\' around the world!',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Simply the best for non artificial flavored bubble teas I have ever had!!! I usually just get the pearl milk tea or the QQ Taiwan mango juice. I love how you can customize the sugar and ice levels. I usually opt out on both since I find the drinks already sufficiently sweet enough and you get a few more sips without the ice. Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste. If you want a cheaper bubble tea you'll be compromising on quality and taste and will probably end up with a sugar laden drink made with some powder or liquid mixture of synthetic flavours. I've been here on such a frequent basis that I've completed two stamp cards an counting!\",\n",

This place is extremely busy, so it took a while before we were able to take an order. We were very confused with the system of how the drinks are ordered, which we came out with drinks that we were not too impressed with. The woman taking our order wasn't clear when she was asking about how we wanted our drink to be made. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU GO, THE WORKERS THERE DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF THIS BUBBLE TEA PLACE. Our orders included: Fairy Vanilla Bubble Tea, little ice, no tapioca (I was so confused why my drink didn't have any tapioca) Taro Smoothie, with no sugar, tapioca (which my friend didn't even know the lady behind the counter even asked) Pearl Milk Tea, with no ice, tapioca All these drinks were far from what we wanted.

My friend suggested that I try the Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly. She even specifically told me to order it with less ice and 80% sugar. The taste is pretty interesting and I like it. For whatever reason, it reminds me of VitaSoy's malted soybean milk. Mmm...and I love grass jelly! I took another friend of mine to try their Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly last night. Despite being a rainy Wednesday evening, we still had to wait 20 minutes in line. This little teashop was incredibly crowded. But once I placed our order, it was not long before we received our drinks. The cashier also gave me a reward card last night. You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...) I'm sure I will return because I like the fact that they give you the option to choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, and the Roasted Milk Tea is pretty good.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"This is my 5th time at Chatime and every time I am still mesmerized at how good their drinks taste. The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea\",\n",

Perfect way to finish off our meal and cool down from the heat. This place was awesome. First time that I've ever had grass jelly and really like how they give you the choice of how much sugar you want and even ice! Fully customizable, every BBT should be like this and way too many options (a good problem to have). Anyways, we tried: - Chatime roasted milk tea with grass jelly ($4.70 for a large). Delicious. I ordered it with less ice and 50% sugar, which was perfect. If Iived in Tdot, would definitely come here all the time. - Hazelnut chocolate milk tea with pudding ($4.20 for regular + $0.50 for pudding). Definitely on the sweeter side but the pudding was interesting option to add to my friend's drink. - QQ honeydew milk tea ($4.50 for regular) Great spot. Place was consistently busy but not overwhelming. Definitely check it out and try something new from their massive menu.\",\n",

The lines are always long around meal time and post-meal time but I never had to wait for too long to get my drink. Top flavours in my opinion have got to be the milk teas. Roasted milk tea, brown rice green tea, caramel milk tea, taro milk tea, all are my frequent options because so much flavour is packed in in one drink. I tried the fruit ones before but it tasted very generic artificial like other bubble tea shops. Chatime is awesome for letting you choose the ice and sugar level. I don't like my drink too cold or sweet so I always ask for less sugar and no ice. TIP: Don't forget to ask for a stamp card if you don't have one already!

I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup.

It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don\\'t see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what\\'s so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what\\'s with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn\\'t enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don\\'t even know what you get if you didn\\'t--like what\\'s the default ice and sugar? Let\\'s not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca/\\'boba\\'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they\\'re not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there\\'s a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don\\'t get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn\\'t blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it\\'s the 505 or the Bay bus.}',\n",

Once you go here, you will never want to go to another. It\\'s customizable options are great if you are very picky. From half sugar, no sugar, less ice, extra tapioca, and so on. They have opened up many locations, but my two favourites are at Finch and Richmond Hill. Here we ordered the mango green tea, less sugar, half ice. It was good but not as good as the other two locations. I do give it a thumps up for efficiency, speed, and cost!You should try there top 10 best sellers. You are bound to like one or more of them. My all time favourite is the grass jelly roasted milk tea, less ice, half sugar. Though sometimes I opt for less ice, and less sugar. It depends how I feel. Either way, it is tasty! It might seem rediculous to write paragraphs and paragraphs about bubble tea, but it is \"a cult.\" A cult for boba (aka bubble tea term) enthusiasts. Be adventurous with flavors!

I got a mango green tea with tapioca, which tasted good and definitely had the authentic mango taste, but the orange that was added just seemed weird and out of place. There was no A/C in the restaurant, which in a day like today meant it was quite stuffy. If the place traditionally has no A/C, I can't see myself visiting here very often during the summer.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I. AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)\",\n",

Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends. Summary: ChaTime reminds me of those bbtea joints back in Vancouver. I will def be back later to try my next fav bbtea flavor, iced honey green tea!!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"This was one of the first bubble tea places I tried in Toronto after one of my local friends had been raving about it and it was a fantastic introduction to the area with quick, reliable service. I ordered the original Deerioca with soy milk, since my body violently rejects any amount of lactose, and it was delicious. Keep in mind that while you can customize the ice and sweetness levels on most other drinks, you can only change the type of milk for the Deerioca series. When the cup first touches your hands you are greeted by the warmth of freshly cooked bubbles soaked in a sweet and balanced brown sugar syrup. These bubbles have the perfect amount of chew and bounce and all of them were cooked consistently. The closest comparison I could draw are the bubbles from Boba Guys, which happens to be my favorite bubble tea spot in the states. The brown sugar syrup from the bubbles mixed with the soy milk gave the drink a taste reminiscent of cereal milk, but in my opinion it was delicious nonetheless. However, the drink itself was a tad light and could have used a bit more tea flavor. My friend ordered the Iron Goddess milk tea which had much more of a traditional bubble tea taste so if that's your jam I would recommend ordering from that part of the menu. There is ample seating with a modern wood-cabin aesthetic if you want to grab a delicious drink and get some work done. Overall, a fantastic bubble tea joint that exceeded my expectations and would definitely recommend if you're in the area.\",\n",

Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

While the Alley is pricier than most areas, I firmly believe the increase in price is well worth it. The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever. Honestly, there's no item on the menu I wouldn't recommend trying out at least once. Although it is very far from where I live, the ride on the subway is one I'd be willing to take just for this great place.\",\n",

I\\'m happy it\\'s close to my work out studio and use it as an excuse to treat myself to one of their milk teas! I\\'ve had the Royal No. 9 which has a blueberry hint, kind of reminded me of a rose tea that didn\\'t taste like your grandma\\'s perfume. Iron Goddess is a flavourful milk tea which I\\'ll usually pair up with tapioca and coffee jelly and the oh so sweet..brown sugar deerioca with soy milk. The tapioca is very sweet and warm but with the freshness from the soy milk, it balances out really well. As pretty as it is, with the syrup drizzle on the side of the cup..I always shake it up really well because all the gooey syrup is at the bottom, it\\'s like sucking up diabetes right there haha. I\\'m just upset it only comes in the smaller size! I took my friend there and she got some sort of lime tea..refreshing but her mistake was agreeing to the lime \"zest\" which were actually lime bits that made it hard for her to drink. She sure had fun picking those bits out of her mouth hehe.',\n",

I am not too fussed with paying more for tea, if the tea is indeed richer and has a better flavour profile. The Iron Goddess milk tea was very bland and seemed diluted. You can definitely taste the bluebery notes in No. 9. You can try a sample of it at the counter and what they had was so incredibly sweet. Tapioca was good, not as chewy as Chatime's. Service was okay, I would've expected the drinks to be ready more quickly given the number of staff working. Their cup is sealed with a fancier plastic which looks nice but it doesn't seal well and our drinks spilled. Overall I was hoping to find a new bbt spot to go to, but the search for good bbt continues!\",\n",

Possibly one of my favourites in recent memory but I feel like I need to return to try more to see if it's a 5 star! The Alley sits at the base of a newer building and is a stone's throw away from Yonge st. It's clean, modern, and quite spacious for a place in the heart of Toronto. Unlike other spots on Yonge, It has nice light and higher ceilings. It has a fair amount of seating if you want to enjoy your tea there and even the take out area wouldnt be too crowded since it's wider than the 3 other nearby bubble tea places. The aesthetics is a-dork-able... I think it's so cute. It plays off their 'mascot' which is a reindeer. The antlers and face is peppered about the room. Their takeaway container has the antlers coming out of the cardboard and is used to anchor the string that holds it like a drawstring bag. Im doing it no justice in explaining how adorkable it is... just look at my pics. IT'S SO CUTE! Another great thing about this place... service. Quick, efficient, happy, and completely knowledgeable and full patience to explain their menu. You need that explanation because this isn't your usual powdery regular bubble tea. OH noooo... this is the real deal. Freshly brewed tea with in house made boba that are perfect QQ chewy texture. There are so many different teas to chose from as your base... assam, green tea, iron goddess, jasmine, oolong... you get the idea. They also have several instagram worthy ones that have a lovely gradient of colours. With the super friendly staff, I decided to go with their best seller and totally appreciated the small sample to try before hand.... Royal Tea No.9. Royal Tea No.9 - Explained as a medium strength black tea with blueberry flavour. I remember my first bubble tea actually being a powdery and insanely sugary blueberry bubble tea. I WISHED this was my first bubble tea because this would have gotten me addicted to bubble tea but it'd be a happy addiction! This had a nice mellow black tea flavour that was really clear from the first sip... like a nice mellow English Breakfast. Then the blueberry flavour hits you at the end and it's not a sugary fake scent... this reminded me truly of the fruit! I got mine half sweet and feel thats just the perfect sweetness for me to balance off the natural black tea flavour. I LOVED the pearls! They mentioned they make it in house and it was perfectly chewy and soft. Not overcooked. I can understand why this would be their best seller. Definitely beats all other new spots I've tried recently. 4.5/5 With a huge menu of new and innovative different drinks, I'm loving their offering and it makes me want to come back to try new things. I usually stick to the basics... Roasted or regular black milk tea. Not here! I'm completely sold on their great service, bubble tea, and possibly the cutest thing I've seen in a restaurant in a long time!\",\n",

Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

Upon entering, the menu can seem confusing because the teas have names like Dark Knight and Apple of My Eye. Don't be afraid to ask if you have questions! Royal No. 9 Milk Tea. I wanted something straightforward with a strong tea flavor, so this was recommended to me. Strong tea flavor is right. Nothing is milked down or watered down here.

NY really needs to step up their bubble tea game. Bubble tea shops in NY cheap out on ingredients and toppings even when you're charged for it. The Alley charges for toppings, but they give a decent amount for their drink sizes. There was topping in every sip I took! Royal No. 9 Milk Tea: Tastes like the gummy in Meiji Chocolate Gummy Candy. Not sure if anyone else thinks the same or maybe just me. Sugar level can be adjusted to your preference. Apple of My Eye: Not my cup of bubble tea. It tastes like the Chinese vinegar drink that I'm not fond of. Although, it's quite refreshing after getting used to it. White Peach Oolong: There's no sugar added. The cashier recommended me to add pineapple jelly in it for some texture and sweetness. Thank goodness I trusted her! Great drink after a heavy or salty meal and you just want something to help digest/refresh your mouth. The second time I ordered this, I added pineapple jelly and aloe (best decision ever). Ginger Roasted Milk Tea (only comes in hot & one size): Wished they had a large for this. Has a strong ginger and roasted milk tea taste. If you feel nauseous, don't add any toppings to this drink; the smooth ginger taste will warm up your stomach (According to my mama).\",\n",

I wanted to order the Deerioca too, but they just happen to be sold out. Royal No. 9 milk tea is good, with a slight blueberry aftertaste. The tapioca is well cooked. I'm not personally very fond of blueberries so this drink is not very special for me. The lack of tea taste also really threw me off. However, I can imagine fans of blueberry loving this drink. The white peach oolong looks just like a tea bag in water. I don't know if that justifies the $5 price tag on it. It is actually the pumpkin party drink that I really liked. It is actually much better than a Frappuccino, the sweet pumpkin syrup is out of this world!!

I've had the deerioca and royal 9 milk tea. The deerioca was just milk and tapioca, and the royal 9 milk tea had a weird after taste to the milk tea (kind of like blue berries). Staff was friendly. I wouldn't say there is anything special about this place but I would come back to give it another try.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'A wonderful place to get tea and other beverages near the University. The first drink I tried was the \"Deerioca\", which consisted of milk and brown sugar. It tasted like any iced milk drink from the usual Asian tea franchises in the states. (e.g. Half and Half, Ten Ren\\'s, Twinkle Twinkle Brown Sugar). The only difference is that the Deerioca does not have a blended ice consistency. Still, I wouldn\\'t call it a truly unique drink, although I certainly enjoyed it. Another thing to note: you cannot adjust the sweetness or ice level for the Deerioca. Also, the drink only comes in the regular size. Keep this in mind if you typically prefer 50% or lower amounts of sweetness in your drinks. The only other drink I\\'ve tried here was the Royal No.9 milk tea. If it weren\\'t for the positive yelp reviews, I probably would not have tried this. I really enjoyed the drink and its unique taste. Basically, it\\'s milk tea with a subtle but delicate blueberry flavor. I\\'ve only been to the Alley 3 times but they always had samples available. I highly recommend this drink. Additionally, various types of toppings are available. I\\'ve tried the boba, which was mediocre but not terrible. Overall, I would give this place 4 stars because I enjoyed the drinks and the atmosphere, which was casual and friendly.',\n",

At first I thought \"it\\'s just bubble tea, how good can it be?\" But then I tried it. And I realized why she was talking in all caps. And also why I will never question her again. The tea was amazing and made within a couple minutes, the service was great, and inside is just a nice place to hang out - it\\'s a cool atmosphere with the brick walls and all the stringed lights. AND they even give free samples! I got the the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea (as instructed to by my friend), and I was in love after the first sip (love at first sip... that\\'s a thing right?). Anyways, everything about it was just better than all the other bubble tea I\\'ve had before... the quality, the taste, the tapioca. Royal No. 9 seems to be the most popular item to get, but they were sampling the Jasmine Green Milk Tea and it was so good that I think I\\'ll get that one next time. I don\\'t know whether to be glad that it\\'s down the street from my work, because it\\'s so convenient, or if I should be sad because it might be a little too convenient... especially in the summer. Anyway, if someone suggests this to you, DON\\'T DOUBT, JUST GO!',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'The downtown is continuing to sprout up bubble tea shops to satisfy the milk tea cravings of the masses. The Alley is another contender that has appeared just south of Yonge and Bloor, hidden inside the lobby level of a condo. How lucky for those condo dwellers! Hanging out here with a few friends in the late evening. Seating is limited to about 15 or so at tables while they have two bars along the walls that can may seat an additional 8 on the high stools. Since it was my first time here, I wanted to try one of their more popular items. After browsing through the menu, I settled for the Royal No 9 milk tea with some tapioca. I normally get less sugar and less ice but I wanted to try it at their regular level to gauge what their take on \"regular\" sweetness would be. The conclusion is that their sweetness is on the lower end of other places but I would still order less sugar and less ice next time around. I really liked the Royal No 9 milk tea. You can taste the steeped tea flavour and not overly mixed with the milk and the sweetener. The tapioca was a nice chewy texture that wasn\\'t overly rubbery. I hear that they make their tapioca fresh and I wonder if that is still the case after being open for quite some time. Their crowd dazzler is their aurora series of drinks which is in a glass jar. It\\'s a swirl of colours that would remind you of the northern lights. No light bulbs needed here. Look forward to being able to try other items on their menu in the future.',\n",

The Bay and Wellesley neighborhood is filled with bubble tea store from China's Happy Lemon, Taiwan's Coco and Sharetea and Green Grotto. As a bubble tea addict, I love all things bubble tea. I always appreciated The Alley's first Canadian location in Richmond Hill. The downtown location has a rustic and modern interior. Sitting is somewhat limited. I opted for the Royal No. 9 milk tea ($5 + 0.5 toppings). The Alley did not disappoint. The tea finishes with a hint of blueberry. Sugar cane syrup is made in house. Tapioca or Deerioca (as they coined it) are made from scratch; kneading and rolling fresh dough into small tapioca balls. With that being said, the tapioca to drink ratio felt slightly off. I wish there was a little more tapioca. Overall, The Alley cost slightly more than other bubble tea stores and charges additional $0.5 for hot drinks. It is well worth the extra $2.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'I\\'m hooked; I\\'ve been here like 6 times in two weeks. A huge reason is because their drinks don\\'t taste as powder-artificial as other bubble tea chains, and they\\'re good at brewing a strong tea. The Royal 9 milk tea has been an Asian hit for years and at this shop it\\'s a blend of black tea and blueberry tea leaves, but I\\'ve recalled having a rose variety. The brown sugar ginger milk tea is very gingery and refreshing, not too sweet despite not being able to adjust the sweetness. You\\'ll feel the zing and heat of the ginger. The purple rice cocoa is a welcomed spin on a hot chocolate that has the soothing quality and rice-y sweetness of purple rice (a popular feature in Thai and Chinese desserts) The \"classic milk tea\" however is rather bland and despite delivering a buzz, left my tea craving unsatisfied. The hojicha soy milk (roasted rice tea, infused in soy milk!) is lightly sweetened, and a great combo. As they\\'re newly opened the service can seem kind of slow and they call out drinks by the receipt number. So don\\'t come here in a rush.',\n",

Now that it's more accessible at a commuter friendly location, I can't wait to try the various flavours. A popular recommendation is the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea and did not disappoint. The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend. I would want to try their Aurora Series next as you get to keep a cute bottle and it has a pretty blend of colours. I'm also keen on trying the Garden Milk Tea since the presentation is cool.

Their top drink is their Royal No.9 milk tea which is a blueberry milk tea. Veeeery good - I totally see why it's their top seller. They usually give out free samples of this drink near the cash register because it's so popular (I always take a sample even though I know how it tastes already, haha). I also tried their northern lights drink, the passion fruit green tea, and their oreo devil slush. All very good. The passion fruit green tea isn't as great as other tea shops I've been to but it's decent! And the northern lights drink isn't too bad.. tastes like freshly juiced grapes and looks like a cool little galaxy in a bottle - you get a nice little bottle too! The place is quite aesthetic looking with nice decor but has limited seats. There's still long lines occasionally since it just opened - come at non-peak hours or near closing to avoid the lines. I'm a fan! Definitely try that Royal No.9!\",\n",

I absolutely loved the interior decor, much more modern and sophisticated than your average store. There's enough seating for 12-15 people, the main area is quite spacious so you can wait for your order without suffering a bout of claustrophobia, the preparation/kitchen area is kept immaculate, staffs are polite and helpful, superior selections of tea that you'll mainly see at brewed-to-order cafes. Prices are reasonable, though everything in Toronto seems to rival prices of more expensive parts of nyc. We ordered an iced hojicha latte (with bubbles) and their alley trio bubble tea. Hojicha - I love hojicha, my favourite tea of all teas so I had high expectations after being disappointed with boba guys. I can't say these guys delivered on that front either, the hojicha flavour came through but was SUPER concentrated, even the colour (after being mixed in with the milk thoroughly) was 10 shades too dark. I recommend getting it less sweet as it was overwhelmingly sweet, add the sugar from the bubbles and it was hard for me to finish. **sigggghhhh** just disappointing :( Trio bubble milk tea - it was just classic milk tea, 'trio' referring to the 3 types of toppings which were pearls/jelly and something else I can't remember. We ordered it to be less sweet, thank god we did because the sugar from the toppings gave it the perfect amount of sweetness. I was very pleased with this one, and would recommend others give it a go. If anything, stop by to enjoy a decent bubble tea and nice cafe with good atmosphere.\",\n",

Of course, I hyped myself up with high expectations and was not looking to be disappointed. The Alley was quite away from my hotel but in the end, it was worth the walk! I was not disappointed. This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip.

The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about.

When I heard that The Alley opened up in downtown toronto, and near my work place, I was like \"OH NO, there\\'s already a Coco, HappyLemon, and Sharetea all around the same block.\" But, the good thing is, they\\'re all unique and offer different tastes of teas. Honestly, when I visited The Alley in markham a couple months ago, I did not enjoy it (maybe because of the drink I ordered: Trio milk tea). This time, I ordered the, all famous, ROYAL NO. 9! I could really taste the hint of blueberry! Will definitely come again for the drink! As per those who are thinking of getting their trio milk tea, if you like coconut/fruit jelly in your milk tea, by all means ~ but if you\\'re someone who doesn\\'t mix well with a combination of fruits, milk and tea - I might tell you to avoid it and try something else - it is definitely a more adventurous pick!! Anyways, I will be back :)',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

I've loved everything I've had so far! -BLACK SUGAR DEERIOCA (with soymilk): I enjoyed the pre-set sweetness and flavour (which all comes from the tapioca that's freshly cooked with the black sugar). I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic! The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour! I'll keep coming to The Alley especially for their seasonal specials, alternative milk drinks, and I definitely want to try their iron goddess next time!

       "  'reviewMessage': 'On a scale of one to ten; how in love with bubble tea are you? The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It\\'s a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I\\'m pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That\\'s how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they\\'re always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you\\'re in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there\\'s all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley\\'s Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they\\'re famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley\\'s signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow\\'s milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you\\'ll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn\\'t get more solid. I\\'d been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn\\'t described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don\\'t just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn\\'t quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I\\'m not sure what I expected, but what I r',\n",

I tried the Brown Sugar Deerioca drink since it was recommended as one of their most popular drinks. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed by the drink - the taste of brown sugar was very subtle and the drink honestly just tasted like milk? The only redeeming quality was the deerioca which had a stronger flavour and I could actually taste the difference between it and normal tapioca. The Jasmine Milk Tea with tapioca was better.

The molasses alone is sweet as can be and did not contribute a wow factor to the drink. It is something new and nice to try. #2 Royal No. 9. Like most yelpers said has a blueberry undertone that you would not get at other bubble tea shops. Atmosphere/service: The washroom is wheelchair accessible, major bonus. The decor is rustic reinforcing their brand. There is some seating but a nice social space to have a chat with friends. Price: $5-7, in line with most premium bubble tea shops.

I went there after lunch on a weekday afternoon hoping to get some work done and grab some good drinks too at the same time, and needless to say, I was not disappointed. This place is located near UofT downtown campus, which can maybe make the place crowded. Fortunately, at the time where I went, which was on a weekday during vacations, I was able to easily find a table to settle myself. As for the drinks, there are various interesting choices from which you can choose. I went for the Brown Sugar Deerioca. It was suggested for me and it was also a plus since there was no actual tea (I sometimes have trouble sleeping at night if I drink coffee or tea on afternoons lol). The drink itself was fantastic! The drink consisted of, from what I can gather, of the bubbles, brown sugar and milk. The mix might sound uninteresting but I can assure you, it was easily one of the best drinks I ever had. The flavors were very well blend together. I would definitely come back to this spot!',\n",

You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended! It also came in a very cute bottle. The only thing I did not like nor anticipate is parking. It's located underneath the condos and parallel parking there was a hassle.\",\n",

The ambiance in the restaurant is warm and cozy. The restaurant has a nice feeling and all of the employees are really friendly, helpful and kind. Before I placed my order, I told the employee I was both gluten and lactose intolerant. The two employees working at the counter recommended I try the Brown Sugar Deerioca or the ginger sweet tea since I had a sore throat. I decided to order the Brown Sugar Deerioca beverage to enjoy at the restaurant and I ended up getting the Sweet Ginger Tea to-go. When I received the Brown Sugar Deerioca, it was presented in three beautiful layers. The dark coloured tapioca was prominent at the bottom of the cup and a rich caramel colour was above it with a creamy white colour on top. I mixed the three layers together and will try my best to describe the amazing flavour of this drink. The tapioca was fresh, warm and chewy; I could tell it had just been cooked. The flavour of the brown sugar layer and the almond milk layer were fantastic! It tasted like a sugar syrup you would bake on the stove yet it also kind of reminded me of cotton candy. It made my mind think of a delicious caramel sauce. The flavour pallet of this bubble tea was beyond any type I have tried in the past. It was definitely an experience and I highly recommend you check it out too. Ginger Sweet Tea To-Go! The sweet ginger tea tasted really good and definitely helped soothe my sore throat. If you're feeling a bit under the weather this would definitely help you. Now for the ICING on the CAKE! My to-go drink had a special touch most restaurants do not have. My to-go cup was served with a deer sleeve that had a strap that allows guests to carry their beverage out of the store without burning their hands. The drink sleeve had a handle. It was the most adorable drink sleeve I have ever used and I hope more restaurants start implementing sleeves like this. It is very creative and innovative. To see what it looks like, find my photo. In Summary: ... I would definitely return to this bubble tea restaurant when in the area. Tip: Make sure you get their loyalty card.\",\n",

Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'On a scale of one to ten; how in love with bubble tea are you? The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It\\'s a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I\\'m pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That\\'s how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they\\'re always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you\\'re in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there\\'s all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley\\'s Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they\\'re famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley\\'s signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow\\'s milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you\\'ll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn\\'t get more solid. I\\'d been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn\\'t described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don\\'t just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn\\'t quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I\\'m not sure what I expected, but what I r',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Ambience 4.5/5: Laid-back, moose-decorated hipsterish cafe. Very relaxed, with outlets along the window. More space than the usual boba place. Appearance 5/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

For 6 dollars, the deerioca fever comes in small size, which is quite pricey. There's no option to have no ice for a cold choice. Between kung fu tea brown sugar bubble in fresh milk and deerioca fever, id still choose kung fu tea a few blocks away from here.\",\n",

I'm usually not one to get milk teas (I prefer fruity), so I'm pretty surprised at how I've been sucked into their milk teas! So far, I've tried Deerioca Fever, Trio Milk Tea, and Royal No.9. I've to say, Royal No.9 is my favourite of the three - it is light with a hint of blueberry after taste, very different from other milk teas. The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about. Would definitely recommend trying this spot! TIP: download their app. Every drink gets you a point. You can get a free drink after 10 points!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"One of the better spots I've tried! Their drink list is extensive categorized from milk tea to fresh milk to fruit teas. The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great! I definitely recommend trying this spot.\",\n",

While the Alley is pricier than most areas, I firmly believe the increase in price is well worth it. The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever. Honestly, there's no item on the menu I wouldn't recommend trying out at least once.

I got literally way too excited when knowing Toronto has several The Alley locations since my boba tea addiction is no joke. The first thing I would try here is Brown sugar deerioca fever with fresh milk. It was just best of the best! You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended! It also came in a very cute bottle. The only thing I did not like nor anticipate is parking. It's located underneath the condos and parallel parking there was a hassle.\",\n",

The royal no. 9 has a nice blueberry tea hint and the tapioca were decently fresh with a nice chew. The deerioca tea has mostly a milky taste and the brown sugar slow cooked boba is what gives most of the sweetness and it's addictive.

I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

Now that it's more accessible at a commuter friendly location, I can't wait to try the various flavours. A popular recommendation is the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea and did not disappoint. The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend. I would want to try their Aurora Series next as you get to keep a cute bottle and it has a pretty blend of colours. I'm also keen on trying the Garden Milk Tea since the presentation is cool.

The milk tea is very light in my opinion, not really enjoy it when mixing with oreo :( + Royal no.9 milk tea (5/5): does not come with tapioca so you need to add extra topping if you would like. The tea has a hint of blueberry, a bit fruity which I really enjoy. + The tapioca was not sweet enough, but I like its chewy texture tho - Portion: comes in regular size and large size, did not give enough tapioca tho, I might order 2 toppings next time.

However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor.

I don't remember exactly what was in the Northern Lights anymore, but decided to go with the morning dawn since it was Passion fruit and Mango flavored.

You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended!

The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great!

While the Alley is pricier than most areas, I firmly believe the increase in price is well worth it. The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever.

Although it is very far from where I live, the ride on the subway is one I'd be willing to take just for this great place.\",\n",

They have a very wide range of flavors which includes milk tea, brown sugar, brewed teas, and fruit juices. I got the passion fruit green tea which includes pineapple jelly and tapioca. I'm usually not a huge fan of tapioca, but their tapioca is SO soft and chewy. I also LOVED the pineapple jelly. Everything about this drink was perfect and I'm currently craving their bubble tea as I am writing this review. I tried a sip of milk bubble tea and that was delicious as well.

I loved this location just as much as my first experience with the one located in Milliken/Markham. Same type of chill atmosphere and clean store.

I needed to get rid of my Canadian coins but I couldn't tell the value of each coin so she helped me pick out the right amount of change.

Their top drink is their Royal No.9 milk tea which is a blueberry milk tea. Veeeery good - I totally see why it's their top seller. They usually give out free samples of this drink near the cash register because it's so popular (I always take a sample even though I know how it tastes already, haha). I also tried their northern lights drink, the passion fruit green tea, and their oreo devil slush. All very good. The passion fruit green tea isn't as great as other tea shops I've been to but it's decent! And the northern lights drink isn't too bad.. tastes like freshly juiced grapes and looks like a cool little galaxy in a bottle - you get a nice little bottle too! The place is quite aesthetic looking with nice decor but has limited seats. There's still long lines occasionally since it just opened - come at non-peak hours or near closing to avoid the lines. I'm a fan! Definitely try that Royal No.9!\",\n",

I've loved everything I've had so far! -BLACK SUGAR DEERIOCA (with soymilk): I enjoyed the pre-set sweetness and flavour (which all comes from the tapioca that's freshly cooked with the black sugar). I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic! The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour! I'll keep coming to The Alley especially for their seasonal specials, alternative milk drinks, and I definitely want to try their iron goddess next time!

Unfortunately, the classic milk tea was also on the more watery side, and to be honest I think the \"pearl milk teas\" at Chatime and Coco taste better, and cost less.

Of course, I hyped myself up with high expectations and was not looking to be disappointed. The Alley was quite away from my hotel but in the end, it was worth the walk! I was not disappointed. This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip.

The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this.

I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

I've had bubble tea from the west coast of the US, east coast of the US, and now it was time to try Canadian bubble tea. I was pleasantly surprised! After walking for hours at the Royal Ontario Museum; I hopped into a uber and stopped by The Alley. My first impression was that this cafe was super cute and had so many drink options! I was going to get the cute Aurora Series drinks at first, but they take 30 minutes to make so I passed on that. I ended up getting the Alley Trio (consists of milk tea w/ 3 toppings) and their bestseller the Royal No.9 (milk tea with blue berry!) I loved the flavors of both drinks and was highly considering getting another one (but I had to eat dinner so I didn't). If you opt to get a hot drink, you get a cute cup with a deer shaped cup holder. I would be lying if I said I didn't order the hot drink just for the cup holder (haha). The people working at The Alley were accommodating and took the time to answer any questions I had. Oh I wish they would open one in NYC!\",\n",

I've loved everything I've had so far! -BLACK SUGAR DEERIOCA (with soymilk): I enjoyed the pre-set sweetness and flavour (which all comes from the tapioca that's freshly cooked with the black sugar). I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic! The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour! I'll keep coming to The Alley especially for their seasonal specials, alternative milk drinks, and I definitely want to try their iron goddess next time! TIP: They have a rewards app program and they do a FREE Birthday drink (but there's a 5 days limit).\",\n",

I don't remember exactly what was in the Northern Lights anymore, but decided to go with the morning dawn since it was Passion fruit and Mango flavored.

I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is.

They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it\\'s worth getting the free card if you think you\\'ll be back in the future. There\\'s also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I\\'ve been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.',\n",

I get 30% sugar but recently I've been going with 0% which I honestly think is just fine. Theres still a hint of sweetness from the grass jelly and the flavour is still there.

This time, we got one regular pearl milk tea and one matcha green tea milk tea with tapioca. Considering how hyped Toronto is with matcha these days, this matcha green tea felt like it was lacking a bit of that strong matcha taste. The cafe itself is always crowded, lacking space for customers to sit down and enjoy the drink. It is always very humid: makes me wonder what the staffs' discomfort index would be -although, their skin looked all great, must be benefitting from all that moisture. Overall rating : 9 foggy glasses out of 10 beautiful skins\",\n",

My usual order: Regular Pearl Milk Tea, no ice, low sugar. It never dissapoints. The taro has a nice texture to it, some people complain that it's gritty but I love it. Their toppings are always on point. The Tea of the Months are pretty hit or miss. The slushes are pretty weak, just avoid them and go with their great milk teas.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'I was not a fan of Chatime last year and went off around downtown looking for a go-to bubbletea shop and alas, gave Chatime another try and must withdraw my previous review. I have been back several times in the last few weeks and my drink has been consistent every time :) Best pearls in the city, always perfectly sweetened and cooked. I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn\\'t watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn\\'t overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn\\'t see there\\'s an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me. The wait can be long and stuffy but the staff are efficient. Also, get a Vicinity points card and you can get a free birthday regular drink.',\n",

I love how you can customize the sugar and ice levels. I usually opt out on both since I find the drinks already sufficiently sweet enough and you get a few more sips without the ice. Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste. If you want a cheaper bubble tea you'll be compromising on quality and taste and will probably end up with a sugar laden drink made with some powder or liquid mixture of synthetic flavours.

My friend suggested that I try the Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly. She even specifically told me to order it with less ice and 80% sugar. The taste is pretty interesting and I like it. For whatever reason, it reminds me of VitaSoy's malted soybean milk. Mmm...and I love grass jelly! I took another friend of mine to try their Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly last night. Despite being a rainy Wednesday evening, we still had to wait 20 minutes in line. This little teashop was incredibly crowded. But once I placed our order, it was not long before we received our drinks. The cashier also gave me a reward card last night. You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...) I'm sure I will return because I like the fact that they give you the option to choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, and the Roasted Milk Tea is pretty good.\",\n",

The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea\",\n",

First time that I've ever had grass jelly and really like how they give you the choice of how much sugar you want and even ice!

I ordered it with less ice and 50% sugar, which was perfect. If Iived in Tdot, would definitely come here all the time. - Hazelnut chocolate milk tea with pudding ($4.20 for regular + $0.50 for pudding).

I tried the fruit ones before but it tasted very generic artificial like other bubble tea shops. Chatime is awesome for letting you choose the ice and sugar level.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"This OG store needs to be expanded! With the popularity of Chatime amongst late night diners and proximity to Ryerson, it's been a hit for about 6 years and will always be my fave. I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup. Their waiting area is somewhat small so in the summer, id recommend waiting outside and periodically checking in on your order. Drinks were made perfectly and as an alumnus of Chatime, I most certainly miss working with my colleagues. Will be back as I always crave Chatime :)!\",\n",

We also asked for tapioca but it was not entered in(it was not fixed.) I asked for a large earl grey milk tea and when it was done we noticed my cup size was smaller than the fixed large peach green tea.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'Wait wut? There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don\\'t see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what\\'s so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what\\'s with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn\\'t enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don\\'t even know what you get if you didn\\'t--like what\\'s the default ice and sugar? Let\\'s not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca/\\'boba\\'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they\\'re not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there\\'s a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don\\'t get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn\\'t blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it\\'s the 505 or the Bay bus.}',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I. AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)\",\n",

Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends. Summary: ChaTime reminds me of those bbtea joints back in Vancouver. I will def be back later to try my next fav bbtea flavor, iced honey green tea!!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"This OG store needs to be expanded! With the popularity of Chatime amongst late night diners and proximity to Ryerson, it's been a hit for about 6 years and will always be my fave. I remember prior to Chatime being open in the town where my university was located, I would come here before boarding the greyhound bus nearby. The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins. Kudos to the friendly cashier who wasn't even phased by the growing lineup. Their waiting area is somewhat small so in the summer, id recommend waiting outside and periodically checking in on your order. Drinks were made perfectly and as an alumnus of Chatime, I most certainly miss working with my colleagues. Will be back as I always crave Chatime :)!\",\n",

I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is. It can get really crowded even if you are just getting takeout. There isn't much space for you to stand while waiting for your drink.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'The line up, which can sometimes go all the way to the back of the store and wrap back towards the entrance, can get a bit unruly during rush hour, but for bubble tea addicts like me, Chatime is a staple. They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it\\'s worth getting the free card if you think you\\'ll be back in the future. There\\'s also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I\\'ve been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.',\n",

Line ups at this location is always long reaching to the end of the restaurant, it's around a 10-15 minute wait. I always get it with roasted jelly which is BOMB. I get 30% sugar but recently I've been going with 0% which I honestly think is just fine. Theres still a hint of sweetness from the grass jelly and the flavour is still there. Other drinks I really enjoy is the Oolong milk tea and the taro milk tea, both super good, taro especially. You can tasted the real flavour of the taro and the texture.

I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn\\'t watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn\\'t overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn\\'t see there\\'s an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me.

The shop is constantly filled with weaving lines that make it difficult to find seating. Good problems?

I always ask for \"less ice\". Who needs a drink that cold? 4) Take a good look at their entire menu - they offer 80+ flavours. You\\'ll have a great chance to check it out while waiting in line.

I love how you can customize the sugar and ice levels. I usually opt out on both since I find the drinks already sufficiently sweet enough and you get a few more sips without the ice. Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste. If you want a cheaper bubble tea you'll be compromising on quality and taste and will probably end up with a sugar laden drink made with some powder or liquid mixture of synthetic flavours.

My friend suggested that I try the Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly. She even specifically told me to order it with less ice and 80% sugar. The taste is pretty interesting and I like it. For whatever reason, it reminds me of VitaSoy's malted soybean milk. Mmm...and I love grass jelly! I took another friend of mine to try their Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly last night. Despite being a rainy Wednesday evening, we still had to wait 20 minutes in line. This little teashop was incredibly crowded. But once I placed our order, it was not long before we received our drinks. The cashier also gave me a reward card last night. You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...) I'm sure I will return because I like the fact that they give you the option to choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, and the Roasted Milk Tea is pretty good.\",\n",

The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea\",\n",

First time that I've ever had grass jelly and really like how they give you the choice of how much sugar you want and even ice!

I ordered it with less ice and 50% sugar, which was perfect. If Iived in Tdot, would definitely come here all the time. - Hazelnut chocolate milk tea with pudding ($4.20 for regular + $0.50 for pudding). Definitely on the sweeter side but the pudding was interesting option to add to my friend's drink. - QQ honeydew milk tea ($4.50 for regular) Great spot.

I tried the fruit ones before but it tasted very generic artificial like other bubble tea shops. Chatime is awesome for letting you choose the ice and sugar level.

The store has enough seating for ~20 people and you wait in line behind their preparation area. My fave is grass jelly milk tea and peach green tea with aloe, both half sugar and less ice The crowds were still here at 11PM on Friday, and our wait was about 10 mins.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'Wait wut? There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don\\'t see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what\\'s so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what\\'s with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn\\'t enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don\\'t even know what you get if you didn\\'t--like what\\'s the default ice and sugar? Let\\'s not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca/\\'boba\\'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they\\'re not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there\\'s a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don\\'t get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn\\'t blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it\\'s the 505 or the Bay bus.}',\n",

Once you go here, you will never want to go to another. It\\'s customizable options are great if you are very picky. From half sugar, no sugar, less ice, extra tapioca, and so on. They have opened up many locations, but my two favourites are at Finch and Richmond Hill. Here we ordered the mango green tea, less sugar, half ice. It was good but not as good as the other two locations. I do give it a thumps up for efficiency, speed, and cost!You should try there top 10 best sellers. You are bound to like one or more of them. My all time favourite is the grass jelly roasted milk tea, less ice, half sugar. Though sometimes I opt for less ice, and less sugar. It depends how I feel. Either way, it is tasty! It might seem rediculous to write paragraphs and paragraphs about bubble tea, but it is \"a cult.\" A cult for boba (aka bubble tea term) enthusiasts. Be adventurous with flavors!

I got a mango green tea with tapioca, which tasted good and definitely had the authentic mango taste, but the orange that was added just seemed weird and out of place.

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I. AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)\",\n",

Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends. Summary: ChaTime reminds me of those bbtea joints back in Vancouver. I will def be back later to try my next fav bbtea flavor, iced honey green tea!!\",\n",

They have a great selection of drinks (I do actually really recommend trying their traditional chinese tea items like \"Iron Goddess Tea\"; they make it pretty authentically here). Drinks price range from $5-7. Oh, regarding their newer menu item \"Deerioca\": for those with lactose intolerance (even if mild), be careful! I had a upset stomach afterwards. The combination of milk with tapioca did not settle well with my system.',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"This was one of the first bubble tea places I tried in Toronto after one of my local friends had been raving about it and it was a fantastic introduction to the area with quick, reliable service. I ordered the original Deerioca with soy milk, since my body violently rejects any amount of lactose, and it was delicious. Keep in mind that while you can customize the ice and sweetness levels on most other drinks, you can only change the type of milk for the Deerioca series. When the cup first touches your hands you are greeted by the warmth of freshly cooked bubbles soaked in a sweet and balanced brown sugar syrup. These bubbles have the perfect amount of chew and bounce and all of them were cooked consistently. The closest comparison I could draw are the bubbles from Boba Guys, which happens to be my favorite bubble tea spot in the states. The brown sugar syrup from the bubbles mixed with the soy milk gave the drink a taste reminiscent of cereal milk, but in my opinion it was delicious nonetheless. However, the drink itself was a tad light and could have used a bit more tea flavor. My friend ordered the Iron Goddess milk tea which had much more of a traditional bubble tea taste so if that's your jam I would recommend ordering from that part of the menu. There is ample seating with a modern wood-cabin aesthetic if you want to grab a delicious drink and get some work done. Overall, a fantastic bubble tea joint that exceeded my expectations and would definitely recommend if you're in the area.\",\n",

However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

While the Alley is pricier than most areas, I firmly believe the increase in price is well worth it. The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever. Honestly, there's no item on the menu I wouldn't recommend trying out at least once. Although it is very far from where I live, the ride on the subway is one I'd be willing to take just for this great place.\",\n",

I\\'m happy it\\'s close to my work out studio and use it as an excuse to treat myself to one of their milk teas! I\\'ve had the Royal No. 9 which has a blueberry hint, kind of reminded me of a rose tea that didn\\'t taste like your grandma\\'s perfume. Iron Goddess is a flavourful milk tea which I\\'ll usually pair up with tapioca and coffee jelly and the oh so sweet..brown sugar deerioca with soy milk. The tapioca is very sweet and warm but with the freshness from the soy milk, it balances out really well. As pretty as it is, with the syrup drizzle on the side of the cup..I always shake it up really well because all the gooey syrup is at the bottom, it\\'s like sucking up diabetes right there haha. I\\'m just upset it only comes in the smaller size! I took my friend there and she got some sort of lime tea..refreshing but her mistake was agreeing to the lime \"zest\" which were actually lime bits that made it hard for her to drink. She sure had fun picking those bits out of her mouth hehe.',\n",

I am not too fussed with paying more for tea, if the tea is indeed richer and has a better flavour profile. The Iron Goddess milk tea was very bland and seemed diluted. You can definitely taste the bluebery notes in No. 9. You can try a sample of it at the counter and what they had was so incredibly sweet. Tapioca was good, not as chewy as Chatime's. Service was okay, I would've expected the drinks to be ready more quickly given the number of staff working. Their cup is sealed with a fancier plastic which looks nice but it doesn't seal well and our drinks spilled. Overall I was hoping to find a new bbt spot to go to, but the search for good bbt continues!\",\n",

Possibly one of my favourites in recent memory but I feel like I need to return to try more to see if it's a 5 star! The Alley sits at the base of a newer building and is a stone's throw away from Yonge st. It's clean, modern, and quite spacious for a place in the heart of Toronto. Unlike other spots on Yonge, It has nice light and higher ceilings. It has a fair amount of seating if you want to enjoy your tea there and even the take out area wouldnt be too crowded since it's wider than the 3 other nearby bubble tea places. The aesthetics is a-dork-able... I think it's so cute. It plays off their 'mascot' which is a reindeer. The antlers and face is peppered about the room. Their takeaway container has the antlers coming out of the cardboard and is used to anchor the string that holds it like a drawstring bag. Im doing it no justice in explaining how adorkable it is... just look at my pics. IT'S SO CUTE! Another great thing about this place... service. Quick, efficient, happy, and completely knowledgeable and full patience to explain their menu. You need that explanation because this isn't your usual powdery regular bubble tea. OH noooo... this is the real deal. Freshly brewed tea with in house made boba that are perfect QQ chewy texture. There are so many different teas to chose from as your base... assam, green tea, iron goddess, jasmine, oolong... you get the idea. They also have several instagram worthy ones that have a lovely gradient of colours. With the super friendly staff, I decided to go with their best seller and totally appreciated the small sample to try before hand.... Royal Tea No.9. Royal Tea No.9 - Explained as a medium strength black tea with blueberry flavour. I remember my first bubble tea actually being a powdery and insanely sugary blueberry bubble tea. I WISHED this was my first bubble tea because this would have gotten me addicted to bubble tea but it'd be a happy addiction! This had a nice mellow black tea flavour that was really clear from the first sip... like a nice mellow English Breakfast. Then the blueberry flavour hits you at the end and it's not a sugary fake scent... this reminded me truly of the fruit! I got mine half sweet and feel thats just the perfect sweetness for me to balance off the natural black tea flavour. I LOVED the pearls! They mentioned they make it in house and it was perfectly chewy and soft. Not overcooked. I can understand why this would be their best seller. Definitely beats all other new spots I've tried recently. 4.5/5 With a huge menu of new and innovative different drinks, I'm loving their offering and it makes me want to come back to try new things. I usually stick to the basics... Roasted or regular black milk tea. Not here! I'm completely sold on their great service, bubble tea, and possibly the cutest thing I've seen in a restaurant in a long time!\",\n",

Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

I wanted something straightforward with a strong tea flavor, so this was recommended to me. Strong tea flavor is right. Nothing is milked down or watered down here.

NY really needs to step up their bubble tea game. Bubble tea shops in NY cheap out on ingredients and toppings even when you're charged for it. The Alley charges for toppings, but they give a decent amount for their drink sizes. There was topping in every sip I took! Royal No. 9 Milk Tea: Tastes like the gummy in Meiji Chocolate Gummy Candy. Not sure if anyone else thinks the same or maybe just me. Sugar level can be adjusted to your preference. Apple of My Eye: Not my cup of bubble tea. It tastes like the Chinese vinegar drink that I'm not fond of. Although, it's quite refreshing after getting used to it. White Peach Oolong: There's no sugar added. The cashier recommended me to add pineapple jelly in it for some texture and sweetness. Thank goodness I trusted her! Great drink after a heavy or salty meal and you just want something to help digest/refresh your mouth. The second time I ordered this, I added pineapple jelly and aloe (best decision ever). Ginger Roasted Milk Tea (only comes in hot & one size): Wished they had a large for this. Has a strong ginger and roasted milk tea taste. If you feel nauseous, don't add any toppings to this drink; the smooth ginger taste will warm up your stomach (According to my mama).\",\n",

I'm not personally very fond of blueberries so this drink is not very special for me. The lack of tea taste also really threw me off. However, I can imagine fans of blueberry loving this drink. The white peach oolong looks just like a tea bag in water. I don't know if that justifies the $5 price tag on it. It is actually the pumpkin party drink that I really liked. It is actually much better than a Frappuccino, the sweet pumpkin syrup is out of this world!! I will come back to try their Deerioca one day, but given the higher price tag, I won't come back as a regular. Download their rewards app if you're back often.\",\n",

I've had the deerioca and royal 9 milk tea. The deerioca was just milk and tapioca, and the royal 9 milk tea had a weird after taste to the milk tea (kind of like blue berries). Staff was friendly.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'A wonderful place to get tea and other beverages near the University. The first drink I tried was the \"Deerioca\", which consisted of milk and brown sugar. It tasted like any iced milk drink from the usual Asian tea franchises in the states. (e.g. Half and Half, Ten Ren\\'s, Twinkle Twinkle Brown Sugar). The only difference is that the Deerioca does not have a blended ice consistency. Still, I wouldn\\'t call it a truly unique drink, although I certainly enjoyed it. Another thing to note: you cannot adjust the sweetness or ice level for the Deerioca. Also, the drink only comes in the regular size. Keep this in mind if you typically prefer 50% or lower amounts of sweetness in your drinks. The only other drink I\\'ve tried here was the Royal No.9 milk tea. If it weren\\'t for the positive yelp reviews, I probably would not have tried this. I really enjoyed the drink and its unique taste. Basically, it\\'s milk tea with a subtle but delicate blueberry flavor. I\\'ve only been to the Alley 3 times but they always had samples available. I highly recommend this drink. Additionally, various types of toppings are available. I\\'ve tried the boba, which was mediocre but not terrible. Overall, I would give this place 4 stars because I enjoyed the drinks and the atmosphere, which was casual and friendly.',\n",

Anyways, everything about it was just better than all the other bubble tea I\\'ve had before... the quality, the taste, the tapioca. Royal No. 9 seems to be the most popular item to get, but they were sampling the Jasmine Green Milk Tea and it was so good that I think I\\'ll get that one next time. I don\\'t know whether to be glad that it\\'s down the street from my work, because it\\'s so convenient, or if I should be sad because it might be a little too convenient... especially in the summer.

       "  'reviewMessage': 'The downtown is continuing to sprout up bubble tea shops to satisfy the milk tea cravings of the masses. The Alley is another contender that has appeared just south of Yonge and Bloor, hidden inside the lobby level of a condo. How lucky for those condo dwellers! Hanging out here with a few friends in the late evening. Seating is limited to about 15 or so at tables while they have two bars along the walls that can may seat an additional 8 on the high stools. Since it was my first time here, I wanted to try one of their more popular items. After browsing through the menu, I settled for the Royal No 9 milk tea with some tapioca. I normally get less sugar and less ice but I wanted to try it at their regular level to gauge what their take on \"regular\" sweetness would be. The conclusion is that their sweetness is on the lower end of other places but I would still order less sugar and less ice next time around. I really liked the Royal No 9 milk tea. You can taste the steeped tea flavour and not overly mixed with the milk and the sweetener. The tapioca was a nice chewy texture that wasn\\'t overly rubbery. I hear that they make their tapioca fresh and I wonder if that is still the case after being open for quite some time. Their crowd dazzler is their aurora series of drinks which is in a glass jar. It\\'s a swirl of colours that would remind you of the northern lights. No light bulbs needed here. Look forward to being able to try other items on their menu in the future.',\n",

The Bay and Wellesley neighborhood is filled with bubble tea store from China's Happy Lemon, Taiwan's Coco and Sharetea and Green Grotto. As a bubble tea addict, I love all things bubble tea. I always appreciated The Alley's first Canadian location in Richmond Hill. The downtown location has a rustic and modern interior. Sitting is somewhat limited. I opted for the Royal No. 9 milk tea ($5 + 0.5 toppings). The Alley did not disappoint. The tea finishes with a hint of blueberry. Sugar cane syrup is made in house. Tapioca or Deerioca (as they coined it) are made from scratch; kneading and rolling fresh dough into small tapioca balls. With that being said, the tapioca to drink ratio felt slightly off. I wish there was a little more tapioca. Overall, The Alley cost slightly more than other bubble tea stores and charges additional $0.5 for hot drinks. It is well worth the extra $2.\",\n",

A huge reason is because their drinks don\\'t taste as powder-artificial as other bubble tea chains, and they\\'re good at brewing a strong tea. The Royal 9 milk tea has been an Asian hit for years and at this shop it\\'s a blend of black tea and blueberry tea leaves, but I\\'ve recalled having a rose variety. The brown sugar ginger milk tea is very gingery and refreshing, not too sweet despite not being able to adjust the sweetness. You\\'ll feel the zing and heat of the ginger. The purple rice cocoa is a welcomed spin on a hot chocolate that has the soothing quality and rice-y sweetness of purple rice (a popular feature in Thai and Chinese desserts) The \"classic milk tea\" however is rather bland and despite delivering a buzz, left my tea craving unsatisfied. The hojicha soy milk (roasted rice tea, infused in soy milk!) is lightly sweetened, and a great combo. As they\\'re newly opened the service can seem kind of slow and they call out drinks by the receipt number. So don\\'t come here in a rush.',\n",

Now that it's more accessible at a commuter friendly location, I can't wait to try the various flavours. A popular recommendation is the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea and did not disappoint. The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend. I would want to try their Aurora Series next as you get to keep a cute bottle and it has a pretty blend of colours. I'm also keen on trying the Garden Milk Tea since the presentation is cool.

Their top drink is their Royal No.9 milk tea which is a blueberry milk tea. Veeeery good - I totally see why it's their top seller. They usually give out free samples of this drink near the cash register because it's so popular (I always take a sample even though I know how it tastes already, haha). I also tried their northern lights drink, the passion fruit green tea, and their oreo devil slush. All very good. The passion fruit green tea isn't as great as other tea shops I've been to but it's decent! And the northern lights drink isn't too bad.. tastes like freshly juiced grapes and looks like a cool little galaxy in a bottle - you get a nice little bottle too! The place is quite aesthetic looking with nice decor but has limited seats. There's still long lines occasionally since it just opened - come at non-peak hours or near closing to avoid the lines. I'm a fan! Definitely try that Royal No.9!\",\n",

I absolutely loved the interior decor, much more modern and sophisticated than your average store. There's enough seating for 12-15 people, the main area is quite spacious so you can wait for your order without suffering a bout of claustrophobia, the preparation/kitchen area is kept immaculate, staffs are polite and helpful, superior selections of tea that you'll mainly see at brewed-to-order cafes. Prices are reasonable, though everything in Toronto seems to rival prices of more expensive parts of nyc. We ordered an iced hojicha latte (with bubbles) and their alley trio bubble tea. Hojicha - I love hojicha, my favourite tea of all teas so I had high expectations after being disappointed with boba guys. I can't say these guys delivered on that front either, the hojicha flavour came through but was SUPER concentrated, even the colour (after being mixed in with the milk thoroughly) was 10 shades too dark. I recommend getting it less sweet as it was overwhelmingly sweet, add the sugar from the bubbles and it was hard for me to finish. **sigggghhhh** just disappointing :( Trio bubble milk tea - it was just classic milk tea, 'trio' referring to the 3 types of toppings which were pearls/jelly and something else I can't remember. We ordered it to be less sweet, thank god we did because the sugar from the toppings gave it the perfect amount of sweetness. I was very pleased with this one, and would recommend others give it a go. If anything, stop by to enjoy a decent bubble tea and nice cafe with good atmosphere.\",\n",

Of course, I hyped myself up with high expectations and was not looking to be disappointed. The Alley was quite away from my hotel but in the end, it was worth the walk! I was not disappointed. This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip.

The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about.

Ordered the Trio Milk Tea which comes with tapioca, rainbow jelly, and something else, which is not bad cause toppings are 50 cents each and you\\'re basically spending an extra 50 cents to get classic milk tea with three toppings. I\\'m ok with the basic stuff so it works out for me. Other places also offer their own \"triple topping\" combos but I think the rainbow jelly was a good choice cause it provided some fruity flavors. BBT prices have been steadily going up and the prices here are probably just a bit higher than most places (and not much either you\\'re looking at maybe a quarter or two?) I would definitely prefer bringing people here, simply because of the overall atmosphere.',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Prior to visiting Toronto, I made a note to myself that I would visit The Alley to grab some bubble tea. I've had bubble tea from the west coast of the US, east coast of the US, and now it was time to try Canadian bubble tea. I was pleasantly surprised! After walking for hours at the Royal Ontario Museum; I hopped into a uber and stopped by The Alley. My first impression was that this cafe was super cute and had so many drink options! I was going to get the cute Aurora Series drinks at first, but they take 30 minutes to make so I passed on that. I ended up getting the Alley Trio (consists of milk tea w/ 3 toppings) and their bestseller the Royal No.9 (milk tea with blue berry!) I loved the flavors of both drinks and was highly considering getting another one (but I had to eat dinner so I didn't). If you opt to get a hot drink, you get a cute cup with a deer shaped cup holder. I would be lying if I said I didn't order the hot drink just for the cup holder (haha). The people working at The Alley were accommodating and took the time to answer any questions I had. Oh I wish they would open one in NYC!\",\n",

When I heard that The Alley opened up in downtown toronto, and near my work place, I was like \"OH NO, there\\'s already a Coco, HappyLemon, and Sharetea all around the same block.\" But, the good thing is, they\\'re all unique and offer different tastes of teas. Honestly, when I visited The Alley in markham a couple months ago, I did not enjoy it (maybe because of the drink I ordered: Trio milk tea). This time, I ordered the, all famous, ROYAL NO. 9! I could really taste the hint of blueberry! Will definitely come again for the drink! As per those who are thinking of getting their trio milk tea, if you like coconut/fruit jelly in your milk tea, by all means ~ but if you\\'re someone who doesn\\'t mix well with a combination of fruits, milk and tea - I might tell you to avoid it and try something else - it is definitely a more adventurous pick!!

       "  'reviewMessage': \"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

I've loved everything I've had so far! -BLACK SUGAR DEERIOCA (with soymilk): I enjoyed the pre-set sweetness and flavour (which all comes from the tapioca that's freshly cooked with the black sugar). I tried my friend's dairy milk version and it tasted sweeter and the black sugar flavour stood out more! -MATCHA DEERIOCA: fantastic! The sweeter tapioca pearls balanced out the matcha bitterness -DEERIOCA PUFF: their classic milk deerioca with a DELICIOUS rich cream cheese layer on top -COCONUT MANGO LULU: seasonal special with mango slushy on top, coconut milk with crystal jelly-type balls in the middle, and mango purée at the bottom. Super refreshing and the pre-set larger size and sturdier cup was surprisingly nice. -ROYAL NO.9 (ordered with 'little' sweetness): I'm always surprised that this milk tea has such a distinct authentic blueberry flavour! I'll keep coming to The Alley especially for their seasonal specials, alternative milk drinks, and I definitely want to try their iron goddess next time!

       "  'reviewMessage': 'On a scale of one to ten; how in love with bubble tea are you? The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It\\'s a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I\\'m pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That\\'s how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they\\'re always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you\\'re in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there\\'s all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley\\'s Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they\\'re famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley\\'s signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow\\'s milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you\\'ll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn\\'t get more solid. I\\'d been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn\\'t described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don\\'t just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn\\'t quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I\\'m not sure what I expected, but what I r',\n",

The decor is rustic reinforcing their brand. There is some seating but a nice social space to have a chat with friends. Price: $5-7, in line with most premium bubble tea shops.

I went there after lunch on a weekday afternoon hoping to get some work done and grab some good drinks too at the same time, and needless to say, I was not disappointed. This place is located near UofT downtown campus, which can maybe make the place crowded. Fortunately, at the time where I went, which was on a weekday during vacations, I was able to easily find a table to settle myself. As for the drinks, there are various interesting choices from which you can choose. I went for the Brown Sugar Deerioca. It was suggested for me and it was also a plus since there was no actual tea (I sometimes have trouble sleeping at night if I drink coffee or tea on afternoons lol). The drink itself was fantastic! The drink consisted of, from what I can gather, of the bubbles, brown sugar and milk. The mix might sound uninteresting but I can assure you, it was easily one of the best drinks I ever had.

You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended!

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I had a really good experience at The Alley. My friend and I came here for a drink and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end. The ambiance in the restaurant is warm and cozy. The restaurant has a nice feeling and all of the employees are really friendly, helpful and kind. Before I placed my order, I told the employee I was both gluten and lactose intolerant. The two employees working at the counter recommended I try the Brown Sugar Deerioca or the ginger sweet tea since I had a sore throat. I decided to order the Brown Sugar Deerioca beverage to enjoy at the restaurant and I ended up getting the Sweet Ginger Tea to-go. When I received the Brown Sugar Deerioca, it was presented in three beautiful layers. The dark coloured tapioca was prominent at the bottom of the cup and a rich caramel colour was above it with a creamy white colour on top. I mixed the three layers together and will try my best to describe the amazing flavour of this drink. The tapioca was fresh, warm and chewy; I could tell it had just been cooked. The flavour of the brown sugar layer and the almond milk layer were fantastic! It tasted like a sugar syrup you would bake on the stove yet it also kind of reminded me of cotton candy. It made my mind think of a delicious caramel sauce. The flavour pallet of this bubble tea was beyond any type I have tried in the past. It was definitely an experience and I highly recommend you check it out too. Ginger Sweet Tea To-Go! The sweet ginger tea tasted really good and definitely helped soothe my sore throat. If you're feeling a bit under the weather this would definitely help you. Now for the ICING on the CAKE! My to-go drink had a special touch most restaurants do not have. My to-go cup was served with a deer sleeve that had a strap that allows guests to carry their beverage out of the store without burning their hands. The drink sleeve had a handle. It was the most adorable drink sleeve I have ever used and I hope more restaurants start implementing sleeves like this. It is very creative and innovative. To see what it looks like, find my photo. In Summary: ... I would definitely return to this bubble tea restaurant when in the area. Tip: Make sure you get their loyalty card.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"The Alley is becoming one of my favourite bubble tea places, having been here a number of times and tried many of their drinks. Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'On a scale of one to ten; how in love with bubble tea are you? The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It\\'s a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I\\'m pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That\\'s how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they\\'re always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you\\'re in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there\\'s all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley\\'s Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they\\'re famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley\\'s signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow\\'s milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you\\'ll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn\\'t get more solid. I\\'d been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn\\'t described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don\\'t just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn\\'t quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I\\'m not sure what I expected, but what I r',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Ambience 4.5/5: Laid-back, moose-decorated hipsterish cafe. Very relaxed, with outlets along the window. More space than the usual boba place. Appearance 5/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.\",\n",

For 6 dollars, the deerioca fever comes in small size, which is quite pricey. There's no option to have no ice for a cold choice. Between kung fu tea brown sugar bubble in fresh milk and deerioca fever, id still choose kung fu tea a few blocks away from here.\",\n",

I'm usually not one to get milk teas (I prefer fruity), so I'm pretty surprised at how I've been sucked into their milk teas! So far, I've tried Deerioca Fever, Trio Milk Tea, and Royal No.9. I've to say, Royal No.9 is my favourite of the three - it is light with a hint of blueberry after taste, very different from other milk teas. The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about. Would definitely recommend trying this spot! TIP: download their app. Every drink gets you a point. You can get a free drink after 10 points!\",\n",

The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great!

While the Alley is pricier than most areas, I firmly believe the increase in price is well worth it. The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever.

I got literally way too excited when knowing Toronto has several The Alley locations since my boba tea addiction is no joke. The first thing I would try here is Brown sugar deerioca fever with fresh milk. It was just best of the best! You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended! It also came in a very cute bottle. The only thing I did not like nor anticipate is parking. It's located underneath the condos and parallel parking there was a hassle.\",\n",

The service was quite fast and the staff were really friendly. One thing they need to improve though is the queue for the line. It's kind of all over the place. This time I decided on a jasmine green milk tea (with no sugar). It was really refreshing and so tasty!

       "  'reviewMessage': \"The Alley is becoming one of my favourite bubble tea places, having been here a number of times and tried many of their drinks. Here are some that I've tried in the order of most preferred: Royal No. 9 (blueberry infused milk tea - their most popular) Iron Goddess Tea (like their Royal No. 9 but less sweet) Jasmine Green Milk Tea (tastes exactly like what it is) Purple Rice Cocoa (it's like hot chocolate with chewy purple rice bits, very satisfying in the winter and a beautiful combination) Brown Sugar Ginger Tea (very strong/spicy ginger taste, also very sweet) Dark Knight (chinese herbal tea - sort of an acquired taste, the drink is completely black!) Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant. Highly recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.\",\n",

Now that it's more accessible at a commuter friendly location, I can't wait to try the various flavours. A popular recommendation is the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea and did not disappoint. The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend. I would want to try their Aurora Series next as you get to keep a cute bottle and it has a pretty blend of colours. I'm also keen on trying the Garden Milk Tea since the presentation is cool.

The tea has a hint of blueberry, a bit fruity which I really enjoy. + The tapioca was not sweet enough, but I like its chewy texture tho - Portion: comes in regular size and large size, did not give enough tapioca tho, I might order 2 toppings next time.

The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall.

You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!!

It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great! I definitely recommend trying this spot.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"Alright, I may have talked badly about the North York branch of Alley, but this one is definitely top-notch bubble tea. While the Alley is pricier than most areas, I firmly believe the increase in price is well worth it. The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever. Honestly, there's no item on the menu I wouldn't recommend trying out at least once. Although it is very far from where I live, the ride on the subway is one I'd be willing to take just for this great place.\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"This is probably my favorite bubble tea joint that I have ever tried. They have a very wide range of flavors which includes milk tea, brown sugar, brewed teas, and fruit juices. I got the passion fruit green tea which includes pineapple jelly and tapioca. I'm usually not a huge fan of tapioca, but their tapioca is SO soft and chewy. I also LOVED the pineapple jelly. Everything about this drink was perfect and I'm currently craving their bubble tea as I am writing this review. I tried a sip of milk bubble tea and that was delicious as well. I highly recommend coming here for bubble tea!!\",\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': 'This bubble tea is the best that Toronto has to offer. We ordered the Trio , passion fruit green tea and the Royale no.9. The alley trio is my favorite out of the drinks , the sugar level should be set at around 70 or 80% with less ice. The no.9 Royale tastes like earl grey tea. By far the best that I have tried. A must go if you are in Toronto !',\n",

       "  'reviewMessage': \"I had to stop by The Alley one last time before our long drive back to Chicago. I loved this location just as much as my first experience with the one located in Milliken/Markham. Same type of chill atmosphere and clean store. I ordered the usual passion fruit green tea with less sugar, less ice and just the pineapple jelly. It was perfect! The employees there are really cheerful, patient and helpful! I needed to get rid of my Canadian coins but I couldn't tell the value of each coin so she helped me pick out the right amount of change. I really appreciated that kind of help- making a foreigner feel at ease! If you live in the area or are just visiting like I am, stop by and hang out at The Alley. Nice atmosphere, great employees and best of all yummy drinks!\",\n",
