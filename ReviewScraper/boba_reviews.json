It is nearby Yonge-Dundas square, the mall, restaurants, and the theatre. I come here pretty often since its closeby to the places I hangout around. I have tried many of their products. My favorites are the roasted milk tea, brewed oolong, honeydew milk tea, and brown rice green tea. I am not a huge fan of their juices or anything fruity flavor. I personally like the milk-based drinks. I like their tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding for toppings. In terms of sweetness, I generally ask for zero sweetness because everything is already quite sweet for my liking. One thing I don't like about this location is how tiny it is. It can get really crowded even if you are just getting takeout. There isn't much space for you to stand while waiting for your drink.","_id":{"$oid":"b6ba5f5b009611edb50cd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"b50ef315009611ed9159d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"J L.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"6\/10\/2017","reviewMessage":"The line up, which can sometimes go all the way to the back of the store and wrap back towards the entrance, can get a bit unruly during rush hour, but for bubble tea addicts like me, Chatime is a staple. They offer a good amount of variety which includes all the popular ones, like taro and roasted milk tea. However, the menu lacks some of the more \"out there\" or unique flavours that one would find at Presotea or Bubble Republic. Like most bubble tea places, you can customize your drink. I always recommend no sugar and either less ice or no ice altogether. This keeps the original flavour without watering it down or making it overly sweet. The loyalty program at Chatime is a nice bonus and it's worth getting the free card if you think you'll be back in the future. There's also the TOTM (tea of the month) monthly promotion, which is the perfect way to try new flavours at a discount. Another thing that sets Chatime apart is that they have a lot of seasonal drinks offered for a limited time. This helps add some variety to the menu. Overall, Chatime is worth a visit. The prices fall in line with a lot of the bubble tea places I've been to (roughly $5 for a regular with add-ons like tapioca, grass jelly, etc), the menu is predictable but extensive, and the additional incentives gives you a reason to come back.","_id":{"$oid":"b7148cf4009611ed9677d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"b50ef315009611ed9159d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Andy L.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"11\/12\/2016","reviewMessage":"Since it's a downtown location (and really close to Eaton center) it's no wonder it's always busy. Lineup all the way to the back and it was 3pm on a Saturday. Ordered two roasted milk teas with grass jelly with less ice and half sugar. The ice was definitely more than what I expected; ended up tasting watered down at the end. It was more ice than I would get at the pacific mall or midland\/finch locations. I'd rather get my fill from those other locations than here. There was, however, a good amount of grass jelly. If youve never tried chatime, you should.

Though I typically go during not really bubble tea hours....like random times during the workday, and it still seems to have a line. As with all Chatimes...I like that they use real tea, not the powdered stuff. And I'm especially addicted to their Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly. Their grass jelly is slightly sweet, so I usually get no sugar and less ice to no ice.

A safe bet is to go with their original roasted milk tea bubble teas. Right when you enter one you can smell the teas being roasted I LOVE IT! It's the best milk tea I've tasted around although some might argue with me. Line ups at this location is always long reaching to the end of the restaurant, it's around a 10-15 minute wait. I always get it with roasted jelly which is BOMB. I get 30% sugar but recently I've been going with 0% which I honestly think is just fine. Theres still a hint of sweetness from the grass jelly and the flavour is still there. Other drinks I really enjoy is the Oolong milk tea and the taro milk tea, both super good, taro especially. You can tasted the real flavour of the taro and the texture. Although I feel the texture of the taro has been watered down quite a bit since a few years ago.","_id":{"$oid":"b84bd46a009611eda64dd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"b50ef315009611ed9159d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Marz R.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"3\/19\/2016","reviewMessage":"This location isn't as good as some of the others.

They were surprised at how busy it was and automatically had high hopes for this place, and they were not disappointed. It was almost 11pm and there were still lines winding throughout the store. I honestly think they should consider expanding their store as they were so busy. They didn't have enough space inside to accommodate the line and people sitting, as the people in line were literally 5cm from the people sitting. I do give them credit though for moving the line relatively quick. The Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea was really good, and they followed directions with ice and sweetness perfectly.

I stuck with their Chatime Pearl Milk Tea (Large $4.70) with no ice, 30% sugar. Wasn't watery like how I had it several times last year and the sugar doesn't overpower the tea flavour. The no ice option is great to have a cold drink without having the ice eventually dilute your entire drink. Today I wanted to add coconut jelly for an extra 50 cents and didn't see there's an option for that! But the girl taking my order changed it to \"QQ Milk Tea\" for me, which has both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly, and it was still the same price at $4.70 for a large!! Amazing discovery for me.

Once you have bubble tea from Chatime you won't go back to any other place. They just can't compare in terms of taste.

You receive one point for every drink, and after 10 points, you get a free regular tea. Aside from the Roasted Milk Tea, I also ordered a Matcha Tea Latte. It was very powdery and it was bitter even with 80% sugar. (I will just go to Starbucks if I ever want a green tea latte...)

The tea they use is high quality, I would know since as an Asian I had my share of bubbleteas. Their tapioca is cooked well, grass jelly and pudding are yummy too. Today I tried strawberry pudding au lait. If you are a Starbucks frappucino fan, Chatime's Au lait is similar to that, in my opinion au lait taste better and it's cheaper too! What I also like is how you can pick how much sugar and ice you can put into your drinks. I get 50% sugar usually for everything because I think too much sugar\/syrup takes away from the original flavors of their quality ingredients. In addition I recommend less ice so you get more bang for your buck and when your ice melts it won't water out the taste. Good drinks that I have tried: (don't remember all their names) hot ugi something (it's like matcha drink with red bean inside), roasted milk tea with grass jelly, hot and cold original milk tea with tapioca, matcha tea latte (go for full sugar if you don't like the bitter taste of matcha), strawberry pudding au lait (it has pudding), grapefruit green tea","_id":{"$oid":"bdaa840d009611eda80ed0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"bcbfc7dc009611edba90d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Jonny M.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"8\/7\/2014","reviewMessage":"Where do you go when you're only in town for one day?

My cousin ordered the caramel milk tea, which she thoroughly enjoyed and I had the refreshing sugar cane juice. There was too much ice in my drink and at $4.20 for a regular size, it was quite expensive. I asked for a small size, but I was given the regular.

There is actually such a thing as good bubble tea? Good as in, better than the flavoured powder stuff I grew up with? It drives me nuts how much friends rave about Chatime or post pictures online of their order--you don't see me taking snapshots of my unremarkable Starbucks cups. Hell, I do not understand what's so damn great about Chatime that drives fans crazy for it--must be an in-crowd cult thing. It drives me even more nuts explaining to non-Asian friends why what's with the name. Maybe Starbucks is a good analogy to what Chatime is to the boba world. If the overwhelming menu (most Asian tea diners have hefty menus) isn't enough to crash your mind, now throw in the whole ice and sugar business, which can seem more complicated than a complicated Starbucks drink. Ordering can be daunting for the uninitiated, but the gist is this: you can customize the level of sugar (full sugar, half sugar, 30% sugar, etc.) and ice (no ice, lots of ice, etc.) in your drink. Thus, an order could be stated accordingly: \"A regular peach green tea with no ice and half sugar, and grassjelly.\" I find that all levels of sweetness is a lot for me. Since I have not ever ordered anything without specifying the two parameters, I don't even know what you get if you didn't--like what's the default ice and sugar? Let's not forget the add-on treats. For 50 cents extra per, throw in some pearls (tapioca\/'boba'), and even grass jelly and aloe vera. A single drink will cost in total at least $5, which sounds a lot for bubble tea... or about on par with a typical Starbucks drink. The staff are quick with their hands and get orders going fast, though they're not one for questions nor a conversation. On a typical day there will be a lineup. It looks short, but looks are deceiving--a line from the counter to the rear wall can be 15-20 mins long. There are seats, but often they are empty. We are not anywhere near Chinatown, and yet there's a small pocket of such bubble tea shops in the area. Chatime is the big name on the stage, but for all its worth, I just don't get what the hype is about or what makes it the best. The drinks didn't blow me out of the water nor feel like a crack addiction, certainly not when everything is too sweet. Nonetheless I get mesmerized by the sweet smell of boiling tapioca and red bean as I wait in line. I miss spitting pearls at friends through the fat straw--do kids still do that? {TTC (this location): whatever gets you to Dundas and Bay, usually it's the 505 or the Bay bus.}","_id":{"$oid":"c1b3cf02009611edad47d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"c0370803009611ed8572d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Tom N.","reviewRating":2.0,"reviewDate":"3\/7\/2014","reviewMessage":"I've come here 5 times, and 4 times they got my drink wrong.

AM. OBSESSED. I hopped on the purple Chatime bandwagon late. I was initially resistant and didn't know what the fuss was about, because bubble tea, in my experience, was just so-so. The first time I tried some was sometime in the 90s in a Taiwanese-owned shop in Pacific Mall. It was very nice, but the quality steadily declined as all the cheaper places cropped up and I eventually associated bubble tea with overpriced, flavourless, sugary, diluted food colouring. Then one of my best friends insisted I visit a Chatime with her after dinner one evening and I was hooked. The roasted milk tea was SO flavourful, rich, and unctuous! I adore tea and the tea flavour is so strong. I also like Taiwanese milk tea better because the flavour is smoother than HK milk tea, which is bitter. Also, their roasted milk tea kind of reminds me of Japanese Kirin-brand Afternoon Milk Tea, which I love and never buy in Canada because it's expensive. The taro milk tea actually had taro bits in it! The tapioca was so perfectly cooked! (Cheap places often overcook bubbles, which I hate - the inconsistency is one of the main reasons why I stopped having bubble tea.) I was obsessed since that first trip and have been back regularly since, to the 3 locations closest to me. I'm also glad that I'll be able to find a Chatime in most major cities! :D That you can choose ice and sugar levels is the icing on the cake. However, I have to say that sugar levels depends on the person making it. I've been going to one of them enough to know how to adjust my order based on who's making the drinks. I know, I know - I have a problem. :P My favourite combinations: *grass jelly roasted milk tea with tapioca *roasted milk tea with pudding (their pudding is deliiicious!) Honourable mentions: *matcha latte (strong, good quality matcha flavour that's not too bitter) *matcha mousse (but this one is a rare treat because it's very heavy and fattening - I believe it's made with cream; order it without toppings and have it on an empty stomach) *taro milk tea (I love all things taro, but I love the roasted milk tea more so I have it more) *red bean milk tea (not my thing but very good according to red bean fans) Don't bother with: *the QQ drinks - QQ is nata de coco, which is just so-so to me, and it makes all your drinks taste like lychee (even if you order the mango QQ, it tastes like lychee at the bottom) *the vanilla, hazelnut, or coconut milk teas - they just add syrups, which makes the drink too sweet and doesn't really make the drink taste better *oolong milk tea (it's ok - it's not available in every location so it's worth a try, but personally I like the stronger tea flavour of roasted milk tea) *regular milk tea (roasted tastes so much better because it's stronger)","_id":{"$oid":"c5896855009611edb697d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"c4da324f009611ed8772d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Justine H.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"9\/10\/2011","reviewMessage":"Restaurant: Chatime Bubble Tea Cuisine: Coffee\/Tea\/Dessert Location: Downtown Toronto Address: 132 Dundas St. W Price Range: ~$10 1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5 Extra information: *Wifi Avail *500 Stores WorldWide *Taxes included in the Price *Choose Ice and Sugar Option I've been drinking bbtea for at least last 12 years of my life, and that is A LOT of bbtea and pearls. Without a doubt, I know my bbtea and how it's suppose to be done. I have long list of different flavors that I've enjoyed in the past that includes taro smoothie, green milktea, coconut milk tea, honey green tea, lychee smoothie. When I moved to TO, I wasn't even expecting to find good bbtea here because I was already aware of the fact that it's not very popular in eastcoast. Plus I tried green milk tea at Ten Ren (Chinatown) prior to and it was so horrible that I've fallen into bbtea funk. However, seeing that Chatime has finally opened- I couldn't pass by without trying and I am glad that I dropped by. It's just like typical bbtea joints, drink station at the front and tables at the back. Because they only opened a day or two before I dropped by, the seating area was pretty much empty. There were 4-5 people working at the store, still busy setting up their kitchen. There are many options you can choose from: Milktea, Freshtea, QQ Jelly, Poptea, Coffee, Smoothie and Healthy Series. Ordered: ICED MILK TEA WITH PEARLS: You think that milktea is something so simple they can't mess it up? You are wrong. I've been to so many bbtea places where they screw this up. But at Chatime, it was PERFECT. It was made just the way it's suppose to be with the right amount of sweetness. Make sure to ask for half pearl if you don't want too much of it in your drink. When they make milktea right, you know other drinks will taste just fine. Ordered: MATCHA RED BEAN SMOOTHIE: My mom orders this everytime we go for bbtea. If you love matcha and if you love red bean, you will love this drink. It's basically a ice cream smoothie and you can't really go wrong with this order. She found it to be a little too sweet but you can choose the sweetness of drinks so make sure to ask before they make it. I am just wondering if they have stamp cards so you can purchase certain # of drinks and get a drink for free? For the opening special, they are giving out free upgrade to large size even when you order a regular size (cold drinks only) so make sure to drop by before the offer ends.

I ordered the original Deerioca with soy milk, since my body violently rejects any amount of lactose, and it was delicious. Keep in mind that while you can customize the ice and sweetness levels on most other drinks, you can only change the type of milk for the Deerioca series. When the cup first touches your hands you are greeted by the warmth of freshly cooked bubbles soaked in a sweet and balanced brown sugar syrup. These bubbles have the perfect amount of chew and bounce and all of them were cooked consistently. The closest comparison I could draw are the bubbles from Boba Guys, which happens to be my favorite bubble tea spot in the states. The brown sugar syrup from the bubbles mixed with the soy milk gave the drink a taste reminiscent of cereal milk, but in my opinion it was delicious nonetheless. However, the drink itself was a tad light and could have used a bit more tea flavor. My friend ordered the Iron Goddess milk tea which had much more of a traditional bubble tea taste so if that's your jam I would recommend ordering from that part of the menu. There is ample seating with a modern wood-cabin aesthetic if you want to grab a delicious drink and get some work done.

The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2\/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.","_id":{"$oid":"cda85be4009611edaa91d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"cb5bacc9009611ed9f07d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Ada L.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"1\/19\/2019","reviewMessage":"Can you believe the first time I tried The Alley was...just a few weeks ago?

The tea and tapioca are always flavorful, the interior is pretty and great for studying and group work, and the service is just what I'd expect; fantastic every time. Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever.

Iron Goddess is a flavourful milk tea which I'll usually pair up with tapioca and coffee jelly and the oh so sweet..brown sugar deerioca with soy milk. The tapioca is very sweet and warm but with the freshness from the soy milk, it balances out really well.

You can definitely taste the bluebery notes in No. 9. You can try a sample of it at the counter and what they had was so incredibly sweet. Tapioca was good, not as chewy as Chatime's.

I can see why The Alley is getting a lot of love... it's very good. Possibly one of my favourites in recent memory but I feel like I need to return to try more to see if it's a 5 star! The Alley sits at the base of a newer building and is a stone's throw away from Yonge st. It's clean, modern, and quite spacious for a place in the heart of Toronto. Unlike other spots on Yonge, It has nice light and higher ceilings. It has a fair amount of seating if you want to enjoy your tea there and even the take out area wouldnt be too crowded since it's wider than the 3 other nearby bubble tea places. The aesthetics is a-dork-able... I think it's so cute. It plays off their 'mascot' which is a reindeer. The antlers and face is peppered about the room. Their takeaway container has the antlers coming out of the cardboard and is used to anchor the string that holds it like a drawstring bag. Im doing it no justice in explaining how adorkable it is... just look at my pics. IT'S SO CUTE! Another great thing about this place... service. Quick, efficient, happy, and completely knowledgeable and full patience to explain their menu. You need that explanation because this isn't your usual powdery regular bubble tea. OH noooo... this is the real deal. Freshly brewed tea with in house made boba that are perfect QQ chewy texture. There are so many different teas to chose from as your base... assam, green tea, iron goddess, jasmine, oolong... you get the idea. They also have several instagram worthy ones that have a lovely gradient of colours. With the super friendly staff, I decided to go with their best seller and totally appreciated the small sample to try before hand.... Royal Tea No.9. Royal Tea No.9 - Explained as a medium strength black tea with blueberry flavour. I remember my first bubble tea actually being a powdery and insanely sugary blueberry bubble tea. I WISHED this was my first bubble tea because this would have gotten me addicted to bubble tea but it'd be a happy addiction! This had a nice mellow black tea flavour that was really clear from the first sip... like a nice mellow English Breakfast. Then the blueberry flavour hits you at the end and it's not a sugary fake scent... this reminded me truly of the fruit! I got mine half sweet and feel thats just the perfect sweetness for me to balance off the natural black tea flavour. I LOVED the pearls! They mentioned they make it in house and it was perfectly chewy and soft. Not overcooked. I can understand why this would be their best seller. Definitely beats all other new spots I've tried recently. 4.5\/5 With a huge menu of new and innovative different drinks, I'm loving their offering and it makes me want to come back to try new things. I usually stick to the basics... Roasted or regular black milk tea. Not here!

Brown Sugar Deerioca (I get it with soy milk, the tapioca is cooked in brown sugar and is noticeably sweeter - almost too sweet) White Peach Oolong (peach taste is very faint) Their tapioca is also perfectly chewy. They have the option of soy milk for some of their drinks, but wish it could be made available for all of their drinks. That, or have lactose-free milk available because their milk teas are really, really good but can't be enjoyed for those who are lactose intolerant.

The Alley charges for toppings, but they give a decent amount for their drink sizes. There was topping in every sip I took! Royal No. 9 Milk Tea: Tastes like the gummy in Meiji Chocolate Gummy Candy. Not sure if anyone else thinks the same or maybe just me. Sugar level can be adjusted to your preference. Apple of My Eye: Not my cup of bubble tea. It tastes like the Chinese vinegar drink that I'm not fond of. Although, it's quite refreshing after getting used to it. White Peach Oolong: There's no sugar added. The cashier recommended me to add pineapple jelly in it for some texture and sweetness. Thank goodness I trusted her! Great drink after a heavy or salty meal and you just want something to help digest\/refresh your mouth. The second time I ordered this, I added pineapple jelly and aloe (best decision ever). Ginger Roasted Milk Tea (only comes in hot & one size): Wished they had a large for this. Has a strong ginger and roasted milk tea taste.

The first drink I tried was the \"Deerioca\", which consisted of milk and brown sugar. It tasted like any iced milk drink from the usual Asian tea franchises in the states. (e.g. Half and Half, Ten Ren's, Twinkle Twinkle Brown Sugar). The only difference is that the Deerioca does not have a blended ice consistency. Still, I wouldn't call it a truly unique drink, although I certainly enjoyed it. Another thing to note: you cannot adjust the sweetness or ice level for the Deerioca. Also, the drink only comes in the regular size. Keep this in mind if you typically prefer 50% or lower amounts of sweetness in your drinks. The only other drink I've tried here was the Royal No.9 milk tea. If it weren't for the positive yelp reviews, I probably would not have tried this. I really enjoyed the drink and its unique taste. Basically, it's milk tea with a subtle but delicate blueberry flavor. I've only been to the Alley 3 times but they always had samples available. I highly recommend this drink.

Since it was my first time here, I wanted to try one of their more popular items. After browsing through the menu, I settled for the Royal No 9 milk tea with some tapioca. I normally get less sugar and less ice but I wanted to try it at their regular level to gauge what their take on \"regular\" sweetness would be. The conclusion is that their sweetness is on the lower end of other places but I would still order less sugar and less ice next time around. I really liked the Royal No 9 milk tea. You can taste the steeped tea flavour and not overly mixed with the milk and the sweetener. The tapioca was a nice chewy texture that wasn't overly rubbery. I hear that they make their tapioca fresh and I wonder if that is still the case after being open for quite some time. Their crowd dazzler is their aurora series of drinks which is in a glass jar.

I opted for the Royal No. 9 milk tea ($5 + 0.5 toppings). The Alley did not disappoint. The tea finishes with a hint of blueberry. Sugar cane syrup is made in house. Tapioca or Deerioca (as they coined it) are made from scratch; kneading and rolling fresh dough into small tapioca balls. With that being said, the tapioca to drink ratio felt slightly off.

The Royal 9 milk tea has been an Asian hit for years and at this shop it's a blend of black tea and blueberry tea leaves, but I've recalled having a rose variety. The brown sugar ginger milk tea is very gingery and refreshing, not too sweet despite not being able to adjust the sweetness. You'll feel the zing and heat of the ginger. The purple rice cocoa is a welcomed spin on a hot chocolate that has the soothing quality and rice-y sweetness of purple rice (a popular feature in Thai and Chinese desserts) The \"classic milk tea\" however is rather bland and despite delivering a buzz, left my tea craving unsatisfied. The hojicha soy milk (roasted rice tea, infused in soy milk!) is lightly sweetened, and a great combo.

I absolutely loved the interior decor, much more modern and sophisticated than your average store. There's enough seating for 12-15 people, the main area is quite spacious so you can wait for your order without suffering a bout of claustrophobia, the preparation\/kitchen area is kept immaculate, staffs are polite and helpful, superior selections of tea that you'll mainly see at brewed-to-order cafes. Prices are reasonable, though everything in Toronto seems to rival prices of more expensive parts of nyc. We ordered an iced hojicha latte (with bubbles) and their alley trio bubble tea. Hojicha - I love hojicha, my favourite tea of all teas so I had high expectations after being disappointed with boba guys. I can't say these guys delivered on that front either, the hojicha flavour came through but was SUPER concentrated, even the colour (after being mixed in with the milk thoroughly) was 10 shades too dark. I recommend getting it less sweet as it was overwhelmingly sweet, add the sugar from the bubbles and it was hard for me to finish. **sigggghhhh** just disappointing :( Trio bubble milk tea - it was just classic milk tea, 'trio' referring to the 3 types of toppings which were pearls\/jelly and something else I can't remember. We ordered it to be less sweet, thank god we did because the sugar from the toppings gave it the perfect amount of sweetness. I was very pleased with this one, and would recommend others give it a go.

Consistently, The Alley was mentioned as the best place. Of course, I hyped myself up with high expectations and was not looking to be disappointed. The Alley was quite away from my hotel but in the end, it was worth the walk! I was not disappointed. This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip.

I'm ok with the basic stuff so it works out for me. Other places also offer their own \"triple topping\" combos but I think the rainbow jelly was a good choice cause it provided some fruity flavors.

I was going to get the cute Aurora Series drinks at first, but they take 30 minutes to make so I passed on that. I ended up getting the Alley Trio (consists of milk tea w\/ 3 toppings) and their bestseller the Royal No.9 (milk tea with blue berry!) I loved the flavors of both drinks and was highly considering getting another one (but I had to eat dinner so I didn't). If you opt to get a hot drink, you get a cute cup with a deer shaped cup holder. I would be lying if I said I didn't order the hot drink just for the cup holder (haha).

As per those who are thinking of getting their trio milk tea, if you like coconut\/fruit jelly in your milk tea, by all means ~ but if you're someone who doesn't mix well with a combination of fruits, milk and tea - I might tell you to avoid it and try something else - it is definitely a more adventurous pick!!

I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!).

The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It's a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I'm pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That's how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they're always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you're in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there's all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley's Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they're famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley's signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow's milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you'll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn't get more solid. I'd been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn't described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don't just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn't quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I'm not sure what I expected, but what I r","_id":{"$oid":"d8c505d6009611edb56fd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"d80b4384009611edba0ad0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Lisa C.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"7\/26\/2019","reviewMessage":"I've been wanting to try this place because I loveeee bubble tea and more importantly fell in love with the brown sugar bubble tea from Taiwan.

My friend and I came here for a drink and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end. The ambiance in the restaurant is warm and cozy. The restaurant has a nice feeling and all of the employees are really friendly, helpful and kind. Before I placed my order, I told the employee I was both gluten and lactose intolerant. The two employees working at the counter recommended I try the Brown Sugar Deerioca or the ginger sweet tea since I had a sore throat. I decided to order the Brown Sugar Deerioca beverage to enjoy at the restaurant and I ended up getting the Sweet Ginger Tea to-go. When I received the Brown Sugar Deerioca, it was presented in three beautiful layers. The dark coloured tapioca was prominent at the bottom of the cup and a rich caramel colour was above it with a creamy white colour on top. I mixed the three layers together and will try my best to describe the amazing flavour of this drink. The tapioca was fresh, warm and chewy; I could tell it had just been cooked. The flavour of the brown sugar layer and the almond milk layer were fantastic! It tasted like a sugar syrup you would bake on the stove yet it also kind of reminded me of cotton candy. It made my mind think of a delicious caramel sauce. The flavour pallet of this bubble tea was beyond any type I have tried in the past. It was definitely an experience and I highly recommend you check it out too. Ginger Sweet Tea To-Go! The sweet ginger tea tasted really good and definitely helped soothe my sore throat. If you're feeling a bit under the weather this would definitely help you. Now for the ICING on the CAKE! My to-go drink had a special touch most restaurants do not have. My to-go cup was served with a deer sleeve that had a strap that allows guests to carry their beverage out of the store without burning their hands. The drink sleeve had a handle. It was the most adorable drink sleeve I have ever used and I hope more restaurants start implementing sleeves like this. It is very creative and innovative. To see what it looks like, find my photo. In Summary: ... I would definitely return to this bubble tea restaurant when in the area. Tip: Make sure you get their loyalty card.","_id":{"$oid":"da98b78a009611ed90e7d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"d80b4384009611edba0ad0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Gloria Y.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"2\/13\/2018","reviewMessage":"The Alley is becoming one of my favourite bubble tea places, having been here a number of times and tried many of their drinks.

The correct answer is eleven. While there are lots (and I mean lots) of places to get bubble tea in Toronto, one place stands out to me above all of the rest: The Alley. blogTO calls them the #1 Best Bubble Tea in the city and I completely agree. But first, a little history on bubble tea. It's a tea-based drink that was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s. (I'm pretty sure that I tried my very first bubble tea in Toronto in the 90s.) The main feature of the beverage are the chewy tapioca balls, or pearls, found within the drink. These are often referred to as \"boba\" and are usually black in colour. Today, there are endless amounts of flavours and combinations available. Many are fruity while others are milky and still others are slushy. You can enjoy your bubble tea cold or hot. The options are truly infinite but the one unifying element is typically the presence of tapioca pearls. The Alley is a bubble tea chain from Taiwan that opened its first Canadian location in Toronto in 2016. Three short years later... And there are now 14 locations in Ontario. Not only that, but there are shops in Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton as well. So yeah. That's how you blow up. I visited their original location on a Monday afternoon and they're always pretty busy. Even on a Monday afternoon. I was a bit thrown off by how nice The Alley looks at first. There are plenty of tables and seating if you're in the mood to hang out in the shop. And then there's all of the distressed wood, exposed brick, white subway tile, industrial lighting, and of course the deer-with-giant-antlers logo felt extremely hipster... And somehow not traditionally Asian. However, I got over my unnecessary preconceptions pretty quickly when I tasted their products. The Alley makes their own sugar cane syrup in-house. They also freshly handcraft their tapioca (which they call deerioca) from scratch. A whole lot of care and attention to detail is put into every single one of their beverages, which is certainly a key factor in their success. The menu is large and somewhat overwhelming, especially for first-timers. They try to help alleviate confusion by featuring their top six beverages as \"The Alley's Picks.\" Adhering to this list is a pretty safe bet to ensure a pleasing drink. However, there is a whole lot more to choose from. There are sections of the menu for Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Snow Velvet Series, The Alley Specialty, Tea Latte Series, Lulu Fresh Fruit Series, Winter Series, The Finest Collection, The Alley Original Brewed Tea, and Aurora Series. What do half of these even mean?? Most of the drinks are offered in two sizes (regular or large) and many of them can be made cold or hot. Cold bubble tea is a bit more traditional but a hot bubble tea can be quite glorious as well. While everything that they make is very good and carefully created, my general happiness seems to have landed within the Brown Sugar Deerioca section of the menu (for now, anyway). These seem to be the drinks that truly feature what they do best. This is what they're famous for. Namely the Deerioca Fever ($6.00), which is most certainly The Alley's signature beverage. Only served in one size (regular) and with the option to have it made with either cow's milk or soy milk, this is definitely the first thing that you must try. As with all bubble tea, you'll grab an over-sized straw and punch your way through the lid. My recommendation is to first sip the boba pearls in the bottom without mixing the drink. This will allow you to experience their signature flavour - which is really the whole reason for visiting the shop in the first place. Next, stir well for a whole new flavour party. The Deerioca Fever is perfect because it showcases the brown cane sugar and housemade tapioca in an ideal, deliciously milky way. You get an amazing hint of molasses and lots of creamy sweetness. It doesn't get more solid. I'd been eyeing up the Aurora Series for a while and decided that it was time to finally try one. There are two multi-coloured drinks in this series that appear to be bottled. I was very intrigued and selected the Northern Lights ($8.00). I had no idea what to expect because the flavour isn't described anywhere. All I knew (from pictures) was that it looked beautiful. They make this drink from scratch and bottle it while you wait - they don't just have these bottled and sitting around. It is served cold and slushy. After some low-key digging I was able to determine that the flavours and colours come from a combo of butterfly pea tea, apple vinegar and grape juice. And I have to say, after taking one sip my reaction was \"WOW!\" It was a big flavour punch in the face that I didn't quite expect and it tasted very sweet and delicious. You can certainly taste the apple but I was having a difficult time placing the other flavours off of the top of my head. I'm not sure what I expected, but what I r","_id":{"$oid":"dbb78904009611eda17fd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"daeeed60009611eda901d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Eli L.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"6\/25\/2019","reviewMessage":"I got the iced deerioca fever with fresh milk, and it was amazing!

Very relaxed, with outlets along the window. More space than the usual boba place. Appearance 5\/5: Very nice appearance, very photogenic. The slushee drinks (Northern Lights and Morning Dawn) were quite attractive and came with their own bottle, but we opted for the teas. Value 3\/5: All drinks we had were $5-6 (pre-tax) for a small. The boba:tea ratio was large, so it felt like we weren't getting our money's worth in tea. Taste 2\/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.","_id":{"$oid":"dc1c5613009611ed8be0d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"daeeed60009611eda901d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Shirley H.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"1\/28\/2019","reviewMessage":"Yummy deerioca fever aka brown sugar bubble in fresh milk.

I've to say, Royal No.9 is my favourite of the three - it is light with a hint of blueberry after taste, very different from other milk teas. The Alley's BBT selection is unique and although it is as bit pricier than some other BBT places, I totally understand what the hype (and line ups) are about.

Their drink list is extensive categorized from milk tea to fresh milk to fruit teas. The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great!

Among my personal recommendations, iron goddess is a solid choice if you don't know what to get, and deerioca matcha definitely tastes better than the normal deerioca fever.

You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended!

I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!).

The quality of their bubble tea is superior compared to other bubble tea shops as it has less of that sweetness and more of a pure tea taste, yet balancing the milk and blending it altogether. Aesthetically, the interior of the shop is super calming and gorgeous. It's a great place to wind down and study, read a book, or catch up with a friend. I would want to try their Aurora Series next as you get to keep a cute bottle and it has a pretty blend of colours. I'm also keen on trying the Garden Milk Tea since the presentation is cool. I was sold on my first visit. Will be back soon!","_id":{"$oid":"e24c3f1d009611ed895ad0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"e0b7209f009611edb4e5d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Frankie K.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"10\/17\/2017","reviewMessage":"Love this spot!

The tea has a hint of blueberry, a bit fruity which I really enjoy. + The tapioca was not sweet enough, but I like its chewy texture tho - Portion: comes in regular size and large size, did not give enough tapioca tho, I might order 2 toppings next time.

Taste 2\/5 (reviews written by each drinker): 1) Deerioca matcha - matcha flavor on its own was quite strong, with it's usual bitter taste. However, the brown sugar tapioca overwhelmed the taste of the tea, and it didn't help that there was so much boba. 2) Deerioca fever with soy - Not much taste of the soy and tasted watery. The tapioca was overly sweet compared to the overall drink and is the chewy kind with semihard centers. I much preferred the milk tea and would probably rate taste as a 1 for this drink with soy. They use American soy milk so maybe it's not as compatible as what I'm used to coming from NYC. Not very special overall. Would maybe come back to try one of the more colorful series. 3) Deerioca fever with fresh milk - taste of the milk a little too overpowering. Tapioca pearls had a nice brown sugar flavor. They were a bit hard, which was fine for me since I prefer them with a nice chew, but they may to too hard for others. I got the regular sugar and didn't think it was too sweet, which I like. 4) Iron goddess with grass jelly, 50% sugar, less ice - tea flavor was decent. 5) Royal No. 9 milk tea with coffee jelly, no sugar, less ice - I enjoyed this because it tasted like chocolate-covered blueberries.","_id":{"$oid":"e3899848009611ed8ec0d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"e3015bdf009611edbd3cd0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Chuan C.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"3\/3\/2019","reviewMessage":"This was voted a top restaurant by blogTO.

The first thing I would try here is Brown sugar deerioca fever with fresh milk. It was just best of the best! You would be given 2 options of milk (fresh milk and soy milk) which I went with fresh milk. They only have 1 size for the brown sugar milk tea and it costed about $7 CAD. When the order was ready, you could feel the warmth of the sugar mixed with boba at the bottom of the cup. I could never forget the bursting caramel flavor from the boba. Must try!!! I also got The morning dawn ($8) in size large since it was what recommended by one of the staff. It tasted like peach and mango mixed. Very refreshing and highly recommended! It also came in a very cute bottle. The only thing I did not like nor anticipate is parking.

If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this.

Consistently, The Alley was mentioned as the best place. Of course, I hyped myself up with high expectations and was not looking to be disappointed. The Alley was quite away from my hotel but in the end, it was worth the walk! I was not disappointed. This place is so cute and they have a huge drink selection. You can see them make the drinks in front of you so you can see they actually make the drinks rather than pre-making the drinks. I struggled in deciding what drink to pick but you know my rule, a sign of a good place is how good the milk tea is. As such, I ordered the milk tea! You can customize the sweetness and sugar level. The tea had a floral and robust taste. The boba was soft and chewy. The combination was a winner. For a regular size, it cost CA $5.00. I also tried The Alley Trio Fresh Milk Tea. It costs CA $5.50 for a regular size. The trio included milk tea boba and two types of fruit jelly. Oh my gosh, the fruit jelly was so good! You can probably minimize the sweetness of the tea because you get a lot of sweetness from the boba and the jelly. I had such a great experience that I was willing to walk back here during my trip.

Their drink list is extensive categorized from milk tea to fresh milk to fruit teas. The milk tea series are creamier and slightly heavier than the fresh milk. If you want something lighter with a stronger tea flavor, then get a drink from the fresh milk series. We've tried the Deerioca Fever (fresh milk), Deerioca Matcha, Assam Fresh Milk Tea, and Royal No.9 Fresh Milk Tea. Deerioca: warm drink with soft, warm boba and brown sugar. It is kind of too sweet for my liking, but I thought that it was really good. Note - you can't change the sweetness for these drinks. Royal No.9: it has a slight blueberry after taste. If you like fruity teas, but don't enjoy the artificial syrupy flavorings, then you'll definitely like this. Overall, we liked this place so much that we came here multiple times during our short trip in Toronto. They're selection of drinks is very unique and tastes great! I definitely recommend trying this spot.","_id":{"$oid":"eb2a4579009611ed9a63d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"ea3d512f009611eda200d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Anna D.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"10\/22\/2017","reviewMessage":"High end bubble tea with a dash of aesthetically pleasing interiors!! I first found out about The Alley when I saw their Northern Lights and Morning Dew being gorgeously photographed and advertised on Instagram. Upon arriving, I was really impressed by how spacious this location is compared to the other one I've been to. Be aware that they currently have a deal going on (not sure for how long), but if you choose a white tea (Royal No. 9, The Alley Trio, or Jasmine Green) paired along with a black tea of either (Apple of My Eye, Sweet Dew Oolong, or Honey Green tea), you get both for the price of $8.85. I was quite upset that my friend and I didn't see this deal as it was poorly advertised and the sign was placed really far from the cashier station. In addition, I realized that the prices were more expensive than the other location I had been to (not much of a big deal considering prices in Toronto are usually jacked up). Not knowing what to get, I decided to sample what was available which was the Royal No. 9. I really enjoyed it as it has a hint of blueberry which makes it sweet but doesn't over power the milk tea itself but instead enhances the flavour. The last time I had gone to The Alley, I believe I picked the Royal No. 9, but this time I ended up getting the Iron Goddess Milk Tea with tapioca and my friend got the Jasmine Green Milk Tea (hot). Iron Goddess Milk Tea: Very strong oolong taste, tapioca was chewy but not too mushy. If you're looking for a sweeter option, I would recommend the Royal No. 9 (which is their top seller as well). I personally preferred that one but the Iron Goddess is great if you're looking for a strong tasting tea. Furthermore, like any other bubble tea locations, you can adjust the sugar and ice content of your drink. Overall, I love the concept of The Alley as it offers fresh quality bubble tea and they stand out with their a modern interior (the tree they have is a nice touch that lightens up the location and is great for photos too!). Would definitely come back again to try their Northern Lights, Morning Dew, or Royal No. 9.","_id":{"$oid":"eb59a426009611ed96bdd0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"ea3d512f009611eda200d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Lisa C.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"7\/26\/2019","reviewMessage":"I've been wanting to try this place because I loveeee bubble tea and more importantly fell in love with the brown sugar bubble tea from Taiwan.

Icha Tea (\u4e00\u8336\u9593) is known as the heaven for tea lovers on Spadina Avenue. Once you step in, you can first order at the counter. There are a few seats where you can sit and wait for your takeout orders. Otherwise, you can continue to walk inside, passing through an authentic Chinese tea bar, and you can then find more seatings. It is spacious and quiet. There are many students working in the corner, as well as groups chilling around with drinks and desserts. You can order tea-infused bubble tea at the storefront, and I decided to order a simple, classic Matcha Latte. The shop uses Isuzu Matcha (\u4e94\u5341\u9234) in their drinks, and they are prepared fresh to order. Though the drink does look delicious, it tastes bland. Matcha flavor is overpowered by the milk itself, which means more matcha powder is needed to make a richer drink. It is quite disappointing to try this in a tea bar. Anyway, we also ordered two desserts, which are Sesame Tofu Cheesecake and Matcha Roll. We were asked to wait for 15 minutes because the roll cake is in the processing of defrosting. Since we had some spare time, so we decided to first try the Sesame Tofu Cheesecake. It is a square-shaped cheesecake with crackers crumb as a base. The cheesecake itself has a strong, pungent sesame flavor, yet tofu flavor is lacking. I was expecting the texture to be silky soft like tofu or at least creamy. It is still creamy, but it is on a harder side. After 20 minutes of wait, the Matcha Roll arrived, and it is totally worth the wait. The matcha cream is creamy and strong. The matcha flavor is left in my mouth after each bite. The cake is soft and spongy. The proportion of cake and cream is perfect, so I don't feel heavy after finishing it. For $5.50, I would totally order this again. *** Overall Impression *** There are definitely hit and miss items at Icha Tea. However, the service is great, and I like how the tea bar is quiet and spacious, with many seatings. Though it has 4.6\/5 on Google review, I think it is slightly overrated, as they cannot perfect a cup of matcha latte. I could be ordering the wrong drinks because after all, it is a Chinese tea bar. One item I highly recommend is the Matcha Roll. I would come back again for other desserts on the menu, as well as trying some real tea next time!

Upon receiving the drink, I was able to snap some aesthetic photos as the interior here was very gorgeous and visually appealing. I also did not know the Matcha Latte Milk Tea needed to be mixed up before drinking, but the barista afterward kindly told me the drink tastes much better when mixed. The Matcha drink tasted a little bitter as expected since it is essentially green tea, but a bit sweet as well since it is milk tea. The tapioca tasted very standard and wasn't very bland nor sweet. There is a bigger seating area when you walk deeper into the store, in which the lighting is very dim which gives off a very relaxing vibe. Also, no outside foods are allowed!

If you walk by too quickly you might just miss its tiny storefront. At first glance it appears that Icha Tea is a quick-serve bubble tea shop but if you walk inside, it offers so much more. The front of the shop has a counter for grab and go drinks but the narrow shop actually keeps going and there is lot of seating in the back with a relaxing ambiance. The decor is very cute with displays of ceramic tea wares including some that are available for purchase. There is a bar space where guests can enjoy a traditional Gong Fu tea pouring experience and learn more about Chinese tea customs. If you would rather pour your own tea, you can also get a tea set on a tray with a little teapot and small cups for sharing. Icha Tea's main focus is high quality loose leaf teas from China and Taiwan which still applies to their milk teas and bubble teas as well. You definitely won't find any powdered drink mixes here. I have tried both their tea bar and their milk teas and you can really taste the difference. The tea itself is more fragrant and there are many kinds to choose from. One of my favourite loose leaf teas is the Milk Oolong which is actually enjoyed black but it naturally has a creamy caramel scent. From their quick service teas, I really loved the iced matcha latte with tapioca pearls. The Japanese matcha is whisked to order and you can choose your sweetness level. In general, the sweetness level here is much lower than other tea spots, so you might have to order it on the sweeter side if that is what you are used to. I have also tried some of their house made desserts and they are quite unique and delicious. I really like the Black Sesame Tofu Cheesecake which is light and nutty. I also love their Jasmine Rose Pudding which is very floral and has the texture of a mousse mixed with a panna cotta. Service is always so warm and friendly here too.

The barista steeped the tea right in front of my eyes and I could see the beautiful tea leaves floating in the steeper. My only issue when it comes to freshly steeped tea is inconsistency. This is coming from someone who worked at a tea shop for a year - who makes your tea matters SO much. When I got my drink, it was disappointing to say the least. I couldnt take the rose notes at all. It tasted like a regular green milk tea I could have gotten anywhere else. I'm a little disappointed because it was pricier being freshly brewed tea, but I could taste the notes of it!

This place is different. The drinks are made with freshly brewed tea, which obviously takes longer to make but is so worth it. The drinks are also a little more expensive than your typical bubble tea, but again, it's worth it. I got the rose jasmine bubble tea, and it was absolutely delicious. I think the sugar is already toned down here compared to your average bubble tea, so even if you normally reduce down to 50% sugar in your standard bubble tea\/latte\/frappuccino, I wouldn't recommend doing that here. The interior is really nice. At first glance, it looks like a super tiny shop, but once you walked inside, there's a nice sitting area in the back. I wish I had taken pictures to show just how nice this place looks.

Also, the guy actually cares about his work. He was showing what I'm assuming was a new employee how to make the drink and he was being so patient and showing her how it should be done and what not to do.

First initial sips of both drinks I found it very watered down and did not taste alot of the tea flavor in both. The milk tea did not have a strong tea flavor which I was hoping for and with the cheese foam it just tasted like a very fresh flower (whatever that means if you eat flowers? ) The pearls were a bit overcooked and a little soft and mushy but not a big deal.

There is a bigger seating area when you walk deeper into the store, in which the lighting is very dim which gives off a very relaxing vibe. Also, no outside foods are allowed!

They're a brewed-to-order tea house with a super cute cafe setup at the front of the store (seating for about 10 people), to the rear it there appeared to be a larger room with classical-style tables and chairs (which I assume is for formal tea services). They have a small but beautiful selection of desserts to have with your tea, mostly uncommon flavours like black sesame and lapsang (flavoured from a type of black tea). The desserts aren't overtly sweet but rather subtly compliments your tea. I ordered the lapsang cheesecake with a large classic milk tea (25% sugar, bubbles). The tea was very fragrant, not being overpowered by the milk, the bubbles were a lovely chewy texture with a touch of firmness in the centre. The only thing I might of changed was perhaps increasing the sweetness level to really bring out the maximum flavours of the tea. The cheesecake was to die for, I think the base of the actual filling must have been tofu which gave it a much lighter density, the flavours of the tea cut through the filling, the base was a soft moist crumble and I loved the gelatine film that decorated the top. The flavours married together very well, it was the first cheesecake I've had that was subtly sweet and it's been one of the best dessert experiences to date. The cafe isn't a place for group gatherings, perhaps a hangout spot with a friend, definitely a date stop off. Not child friendly, or wheelchair\/stroller accessible.

Unlike other bubble tea places I've been to, they brew your tea fresh right in front of you. Recommendations are key, as some teas can be stronger than others - so don't be scared to ask! We got one classic milk tea and one osmanthus oolong tea. The wait wasn't bad as there were other customers ahead of us, but what I loved was the connection they made with each other customer. The tea itself is great, especially in the milk tea. It has a richer flavour to it than the powdered milk teas. As for the tapioca, it needs to be a bit more sweeter to make it perfect.

There is a tea bar where you can sit and observe your tea being made in a traditional method (pouring and repouring to get the temperature right). Yet there's a sense of casualness in this old method. Around the bar where I sat, quaint teapots and little cups scattered around in the most charming messy way. You will surely be entertained by looking at the various shapes and art from those tea sets. I ordered the jasmine green tea from the menu, and the girl behind the bar proceeded to make my tea, starting with steeping the tea leaves. She poured the tea from one container to another repeatedly, feeling the temperature of the container with her hands until she was satisfied, then she poured the tea into the pot and presented it to me. With some of the other teas, she also took a whiff to smell the tea to see if they were ready. My tea was amazing. The fragrance was so lovely and the taste was calming. No trace of bitter taste. Unlike wine tasting where you get the tasting for free if you buy the bottle, this tea shop doesn't operate this way lol. You pay for the tea tasting, and the tea leaves by grams if you wish to bring some home. This experience and products don't come cheap.

The price and quality of the drink (to me) is much better than other bubble tea places that I've tried. The bubbles are cooked just right! I think this is the best tapioca place I've tried - they also have a coat of sugar.. which make them less plain! Hence, get less sugar in your drink. They usually have monthly specials - large for $3.80. The reason why I'm giving it a 4* instead of a 5* is because I had a bad incident with one of their drinks. They had a special, which was their black tea latte. Black tea latte is literally 3\/4 fresh milk, and 1\/4 black tea. Much like a milk tea but... mostly milk! I guess the day I got it... the milk was not fresh - it tasted very off. Also, much like other places, I do not think they pay attention to the sugar levels if you ask for 30%, 50% or 70%.

What I would've liked more is if they have real taro bits like they do in Chatime. My tip is to also add Tapioca. Then you'll have a really bubbly day :) MATCHA MACCHIATO: This was my least favorite out of what I've tried. I'm a big matcha lover - the stronger the better. I find the matcha to be too weak for my liking. I also prefer the Cream Foam at Gong Cha. The cream foam just didn't have that unique umami taste that Gong Cha has. BLACK TEA MACCHIATO: I tried this following a friend's recommendation since it's her favorite. I really liked. The tea taste is very strong and perfectly balanced by the Cream Foam. Fun Fact: I find it so interesting that CoCo Tea makes 100 Pearl Milk Teas every second across the globe.","_id":{"$oid":"16fd1404009711ed9311d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"163caf4b009711ed8493d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Sarah K.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"4\/18\/2016","reviewMessage":"This location is close to Yonge and Wellesley which is perfect if you're looking to grab a drink nearby after dinner or just to hang out.

Today, I finally made my way to CoCo to try their bubble teas for the first time. Service: A friendly young lady at the counter, I loved how she greeted every customer with a smile. The line moved slowly- there were a few people waiting with their receipts (a receipt has your order number). Drink: I ordered matcha milk tea with 50% sugar & tapioca. I'm glad that I asked the lady at the counter before ordering since even with 50% sugar, the drink was still a bit sweet. I love tapioca and I have a sweet tooth- but the tapioca from here were way too sweet. It felt like I was chewing sugar balls, so by the end, it was difficult to try to finish them. Next time, I would order another bubble tea with 30% sugar & without tapioca. It seems that CoCo's bubble teas are on the sweet side. I would recommend people to order their drinks with 50% or less sugar, or, with more ice!","_id":{"$oid":"187fd189009711ed9ae2d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"177b6c0b009711edafe1d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Shirley H.","reviewRating":4.0,"reviewDate":"2\/15\/2018","reviewMessage":"Quick service.

I've had CoCo in China before and I thought it was an okay bubble tea joint. I ordered the teas of the month - passion fruit black tea and caramel milk tea with sugar. Positives: Lots of bubbles. I hate when bbt places skimp on the bubbles even when they are charging for them. Not here! They give plenty of bubbles and they are done right. Texture and taste are a-okay! Negatives: Sugary. I got 30% sugar in the milk tea and 50% sugar in the passion fruit. I thought both were too sweet for my liking. If I went back I would just ask for no sugar in any of my drinks. It's possible they keep the bubbles in syrup so it's adding alot of sugar to the drink. Overall I would say for the price point, I would rather go to a chatime or teashop 168 for my bubble tea. The bubble serving was generous but the tea itself wasn't that great. I prefer the more tea-heavy bubble tea places. Tip - they do vicinity loyalty cards so if you buy 10 drinks you get one free.","_id":{"$oid":"1d2f9e06009711edb2d2d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"1c3add94009711ed8051d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Suor K.","reviewRating":3.0,"reviewDate":"12\/9\/2016","reviewMessage":"It has been at least a month since I had bubbletea and I saw this CoCo location while walking to dinner.

Not only is the interior super cute, but they offer a variety of yummy drinks. When I saw they had a purple yam drink, I already knew that was the one I wanted to try! Normally it comes with organic milk, but I love how I was able to switch it to oat milk. The staff were super kind and even remade my drink after I forgot to get pearls in mine, but omg they were SOOO SOFT! The texture is exactly like Gong Cha so if u love their pearls you'll love these too. The purple yam was a pur\u00e9e that went well with the oat milk, and I also got my drink with the recommended 30% sugar which was perfect with the sweet brown sugar pearls!

Several of their ingredients are made fresh in-house. They even use organic milk instead of milk. They have oat milk options. The interior is a modern design with tables at least 2 meters apart. This Toronto location (opened Aug 2021) is their second location in Canada. Their first location is in Vancouver (opened fall 2019). Customer service is superb. All the staff are super pleasant giving service with a smile (somehow it shows through their face masks). They are very knowledgeable about the drinks. The Brown Sugar Tapioca is very soft and chewy, thus good quality. The Brown Sugar is made from a special formula. The Purple rice made fresh in-house but the Purple Yam is from powder. The Taro is made fresh in-house. We could definitely taste the smoothness and freshness of the paste. They use organic milk instead of regular milk. The Sunset series uses a fresh egg yolk and blended in the drink. It is a special Taiwanese drink. It is blended with ice making it a slush. The egg yolk is not that noticeable but the main purpose is to make is a smooth taste, which indeed it is. They have clear plastic carrying bags for takeout. The inside of the bag is shaped perfectly to the shape of drink cup so there is no shaking while carrying it. Good idea. During the pandemic, the tables are at least 2 metres apart. Thee is plexiglass at the order counter. The staff are wearing masks. The soft opening was 2021-08-16. During the grand opening on 2021-08-18, the first 88 customers get a free Brown Sugar Pearl Milk Tea and all drinks are 50% off. On 2021-08-16, I happen to be when a couple, customer numbers 1 and 2, were there. They were from Vancouver and were regulars at Baroness in Vancouver.  They raved about the quality of the drinks. Since they moved to Toronto, they could not find any other bubble tea shops of comparable quality! There were so happy Baroness Toronto finally opened. There is free WiFi. The restaurant is wheelchair accessible. The washrooms are gender-neutral and wheelchair accessible. Review 2021-081 You can also find me on Instagram @chuan_chee.

Whereas a lot of other BBT places use a non-dairy creamer (aka powder) for their drinks, at Baroness they use organic milk (or oat milk if you fancy) and you can really taste the difference and the richness of the BBTs. I've had a bunch of different bubble teas from Baroness form the Thai Milk Tea to the Roasted Oolong to the Brown Sugar and they are all amazing and really fragrant. Their boba is also pretty different as they have it warmed up in brown sugar and the boba is a bit sweet while also soft and chewy (whereas a lot of other BBT places just have these chewy and tasteless tapioca pearls that don't really add anything other than texture). Honestly after going to Baroness I find it pretty hard to enjoy BBT at other places since they do so many things right.

The toppings (especially the brown sugar pearls) were absolutely regal - amazing taste, great chewy texture, good amount. As for the tea itself, it was fine. I preferred the mango to the purple yam, mainly because I could hardly taste the purple yam. Come to think of it, even the mango was a bit faint.

I travelled to Toronto with my friend and passed by this cute store! Very aesthetic and the wall is definitely worth taking tons of pictures with your drinks or just in general! Theres not much sitting inside so I just grabbed it to go. Fresh Mixed Berry Slush with Cream Foam: Very refreshing drinks, can tell that they use fresh berry, I recommend drinking the cream foam and slush at the same time without using the straw, and then try it again mixing them well together, its very different even though its the same drink! The cream foam was very creamy with a hint of cheese flavour but goes well with the drinks surprisingly. Takeaway: - Drinks on the pricier side, not sure if the drinks itself worth this price - but the place is super cute though! - 50% sugar is already sweet enough!","_id":{"$oid":"483c704d009711ed9815d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"473e8854009711eda753d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Binkie W.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"11\/4\/2019","reviewMessage":"I had no problems with this shop today.

The black tea latte was definitely one of the better milk teas I have tasted. The value however was not the greatest. The bottles came to around $9.25 after tax and the volume of the milk tea was around 75% of a regular cup. Will definitely be one of my go to bubble tea places in the area.

I didn't add a topping because I remember thinking it was expensive enough as-is. From that one drink, I've concluded that Machi Machi is just another bbt joint for aesthetics and not for quality. The creme brulee was good and they gave you a lot of it, but the tea didn't have a lot of flavour. I usually get 30% sweet with other bbt shops, but the creme brulee took the sweetness over the top, so I would recommend adjusting sugar levels accordingly. Since my drink was sweeter than I normally take it, it also affected my enjoyment of the drink. Probably won't come back.","_id":{"$oid":"4c1bf465009711edadb7d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"4b41255f009711edb8d0d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Daisy W.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"8\/2\/2020","reviewMessage":"I made a trip to the area just to try this bubble tea shop. I first came across is watching J-Style Travels and a colleague told me it's the same Machi Machi as the one in Taiwan. They are known for their cheese foam drinks and since it was my first time visiting, I had to order something from their recommended menu. I ordered their Strawberry Latte with Panna Cotta while my friend ordered the Black Milk Tea with Creme Brulee. The Strawberry Latte came in a cute bottle with the panna cotta sitting in the bottom. I really stirred up the drink before drinking it and loved it. I do not like super sugary drinks, so I was a little concerned when I was told the sugar level was fixed. It ended up being the perfect after dinner treat! My friend said her black milk tea with creme brulee was great too. She said there was actually tea flavour and wasn't too milky. Price point wise, the strawberry latte with panna cotta came up to just over $8, while the black milk tea with creme brulee was a little over $5. The one I ordered was a little steeper in price but is worth a try. I will definitely go back to this cute teashop to try their other drinks.","_id":{"$oid":"4c5490d2009711ed8503d0ab"},"drinkId":{"$oid":"4b41255f009711edb8d0d0ab"}},{"reviewerName":"Amy L.","reviewRating":5.0,"reviewDate":"6\/17\/2021","reviewMessage":"I'm a huge fan of fruit teas so I really loved this place.

It's a really refreshing drink with apples, pineapple and passion fruit. I would totally order this again paying the full price! The decor of their shop was really unique also.

It will cover up the flavor of the fresh fruit and it won't be as good as before. Usually they would give u a fork so in the end when u finish drinking it, open the lid and u can eat all the fruits, I die for the apples inside, especially if I make my fruit tea hot, the warm apple slices in the end makes everything 20000 times better.

I was the only person on the shop when I went so, I had to quickly check Yelp to see if this place was legit. Ok, 4 stars... I like boba tea shops that let you customize the sweetness of your drink. That's what I appreciate about Bubble Lee. They have milk tea with or without boba, iced tea with lemon or lime, and slush. I placed my order for a Jasmine milk tea with boba.
